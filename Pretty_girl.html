<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p> </p><p>This was it. The show was done. Season three of Inanimate Insanity was finished. It was like a wonderful story coming to a close, only to live happily ever after in the end. And in this case, their happily ever after was...</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"All I wanna do is go to a party!"</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Clover sighed, wincing as the music blared into her ears. Judging by the song, Fan must've taken over the speakers, but no one seemed to complain since it wasn't that bad of a song and nearly everyone listened to it.</p><p>She was currently sitting on the couch, red cup gently held in one of her hands as she leaned back onto the cushions. Everyone seemed to be having a great time, even Blueberry seemed happy!</p><p>As the song continued and chatter filled the room along with it, two figures walked up to her. "Hey! You're Clover, right?" The white haired girl asked, as to which Clover nodded. They each sat on one side of her.</p><p>"Congratulations on, like, winning!" The other said, her hair was black. "Oh, thank you! You're actually one of the first people who's congratulated me!" Clover said, giggling at the two of them.</p><p>That's when she recognized the two women, Salt and Pepper! It was hard too see anyone in this dark, strobe light lit room. "Well that's suprising, who would miss a chance to talk to someone as pretty as you?" Pepper asked.</p><p>Clover blushed, laughing it off. "Wow, no nods to flatter me." She said, smiling at her before Salt scoffed. "Really, Pepper? You're not, like, being subtle at all." She said, rolling her eyes as she drank from a red cup.</p><p>Clover looked towards it, assuming they we're just drunk and didn't mean any of this. "But she's like, totally right." Salt said after she finished her drink and stood up. "I'm gonna refill, BRB!" Then she skipped off.</p><p>This lead to her focusing her attention onto Pepper now, her face burning pink. It was then she noticed her outfit, and it was absolutely stunning. A simple black crop top and short-shorts with ffishnets beneath-</p><p>Okay, maybe it wasn't that creative and what-not, but it showed a bunch of skin and Clover couldn't help but stare. God, the struggles of being a lesbian, she guesses. "W-Wow, you look..cute." She muttered.</p><p>And not missing a beat, she instantly replied. "Not too bad yourself, darling." Holy shit, Clover's insides did fucking summersalts. "Y- I- Thank you!" She said before laughing nervously, then sipping her drink.</p><p>"Pepper, like, stop hogging her for yourself!" Salt shouted, jumping back onto the couch on Clovers right side, making Clover jump in suprise. "Okay, okay. Like, whatever." Pepper rolled her eyes and sipped her drink as well.</p><p>They continued to have their conversations, and then their occasional flirts which made Clover laughs and writhe in her place. These two we're just...so, terribly drunk, so drunk they we're flirting with her of all people!</p><p>Though of course, all good things come to an end. OJ turned on the light, then stumbled towards the middle of the room, drunk just like the majority of the people in this room. "I've come to make, an, uh, announcement!"</p><p>He declared, pointing his finger up, then at Clover. "For Clover! It's uh, her birthday?" He shrugged. "We'll go with that. Happy birthday!" He shouted, words slurring as everyone cheered.</p><p>"Happy birthday, Clover." Salt said, laughing. "It's not actually-" She was cut off by Pepper. "No, we know. They're, like, mindless drunks so might as well play along before a, like, bar fight starts in here."</p><p>Clover giggled, nodding as she watched the rest of the room celebrate. "Wait, aren't you guys drunk?" She asked the duo, making them laugh. "No, we don't drink the stuff they drink." Salt simply says.</p><p>"Oh, that...actually doesn't clear up anything for me." They both looked at her confused. "What do you mean?" Pepper asks, and Clover shrugs. "You're both flirting with me, aren't you guys together?"</p><p>They seemed to look at each other and laugh, making Clover feel embarrassed. "Well, technically yeah, I guess so. But we kind of just hook-up with people we both find hot and well.."</p><p>Pepper trailed on as Salt placed a hand on her knee, slowly trailing up her skirt. "You just happened to catch our eye." Salt finishes. Clover squirmed at the touch, her face flushing a somehow deeper red.</p><p>She didn't know how to feel about this, no, she did. She wanted this so badly. She wanted them both so badly. Clover was just unsure if she should take up the offer or not. She looked at the both of them.</p><p>Salt's hand trailed up further and she was near her damn underwear, goddamn the one time she didn't wear shorts? She really was lucky. "So, will you have us?" Pepper asked, biting her lip at the sight of the two of them.</p><p>It didn't take long for her to decided, without any hesitation, she chose her answer. "Yes." Salt smirked and Pepper seemed to chuckle. "Well, not here. Let's, like, take this to me and Pepper's room." Salt said, standing up.</p><p>The other two stood up as well, Clover feeling as if her knees we're gonna give out on her any minute now. She managed to walk though, but not without knowing glances from the two of them.</p><p>Salt pulled out the key to the bedroom, unlocking it and opening it for the both of them in a jokingly formal manner. Clover giggled quietly, rolling her eyes at the humorous action.</p><p>Clover just stood there patiently for the other two, as to which they just chuckled. "Clover you can sit on the bed, you don't need to, like, wait for us." Salt says, and Cover nodded, blushing in embarrassment.</p><p>"Sorry, my bad." She said, laughing nervously once she sat on the bed, the both of them following her action as well. Pepper on her left and Salt on her right. "Don't apologize. A pretty girl like you shouldn't be apologizing."</p><p>Clover squeezed her legs together, Salt's praise echoing in her mind continuously. Pepper placed a hand on her thigh and moved up towards her face, the both of them just staring until Pepper made the first move.</p><p>She pressed her lips against hers, sweet and tender. Slowly she moved onto her lap, keeping her distracted with the too-sweet-for -her-own-good kiss. She then gently pushed her down onto the bed. </p><p>Salt whined. "You're taking all of her, Pepper!" She huffed as Pepper pulled away from the kiss, leaving Clover dazed. "Just get the box, okay, Salty-salt?" She asked, grinning at her. Salt giggled and nodded.</p><p>"Clover, be a good girl and undress for me. Okay?" Clover nodded, waiting till Pepper got off her so she could undress herself. Pulling off her black tank top and undoing her belt. She was about to toss that too before...</p><p>"Actually, give me that." Pepper said as Salt came up with the box, her eyes immediately being fixated on Clover's half naked body. Clover handed her the belt, which she took and then the girl went back to undressing.</p><p>She didn't know what she was feeling right now, excitement? Desire? Lust? Hell, probably all of the above. She kicked her shoes of frantically before slipping her skirt off as well, leaving her in her bra and underwear.</p><p>Reaching back she unclipped her bra and slipped it off, her underwear following shortly after as well. "Fuck, Clover. Come over here." Pepper said, apparently undressed as well and in some damn lingerie.</p><p>Clover didn't hesitate to crawl over to her. "Yes?" She asked, Pepper then pointed to the bed frame. "Darling are you okay with being..restrained?" She asked, and quickly Clover nodded.</p><p>"Y-Yeah..I'm, into it actually." Salt chuckled. "God you're such a slut." Salt said, barely having her top off. Pepper rolled her eyes, but moved towards the middle of the bed into order to sort this whole thing out.</p><p>"Okay, just lay here for me. Good girl." she said once Clover obeyed, putting her hands above her head too. "Awh, you're so good for me." Pepper used to the best to tie her wrists to the bedpost.</p><p>"Is it too tight?" She asked. "No, it's perfect." Pepper smiled and leaned down to kiss her, before a loud slap ran throughout the room and Pepper yelped. "I found the whip!" Salt said, holding it up.</p><p>Pepper groaned. "Not today, dear." Salt rolled her eyes. "Is there any other stuff in there besides kinky shit? Well, like,..kinky-er shit." She asked. "Yep! Of course we do. We aren't, like, vanilla."</p><p>Clover watched, her mind gazed with thoughts of what they could do to her. Call her good names while they mercilessly fuck her through her orgasm, or maybe be so rough with her she's crying?</p><p>God, all of this sounds so good. Clover grows needy, whining as she squirmed and whined. Salt spread her legs open, snapping her out of her thoughts. "Wow, she's real wet, Pepper. Sure we need that lube?"</p><p>"Of course we need the lube, Salt." She says, giving her the bottle. "Okay, okay, jeez." She poured some of the slightly cold lubricant onto her fingers and prodded at her entrance. "You ready, Clover?"</p><p>The girl frantically nodded, which caused her to push her two fingers inside of her slowly. Clover let out a quiet moan, two fingers not being too much for her. Plus she was mostly stretched out from...past instances.</p><p>Salt placed her other hand onto her clit, giving her more stimulation to wash out the slight pain of the stretching out, which still wasn't much when she added another finger. Then a fourth. "S-Salt.."</p><p>Clover moaned, forcing her legs open. "Shh, you're doing so good for us." She whispered lovingly, and Pepper shuffled over and whispered to Salt, who continued to finger her for a few more seconds before stopping.</p><p>Clover whined at that, causing Pepper to shush her. "Shh, we'll fill you up again in just a second, darling." And in a second she did, slowly sliding in one of the dildo's Salt and Pepper had in the box.</p><p>Clover gasped and moaned, squirming as she got adjusted to the big size. "Mgh, Pepper- I-" she was cut off by her own moan. "No need to say anything, just lay there a look pretty, okay?" She nods.</p><p>After a few minutes or so, cause they weren't mean and just started thrusting as soon as they had it in, they slowly moved the toy for Clover, make her gasp and mumbled to herself quietly. </p><p>"Awh, you're doing great, baby." Salt mumbled as she looked in their box of...toys. "Pepper! Look!" She pulled out a leash from inside there, making Clover look over with glazed over eyes.</p><p>"Ooo, we should totally use that. Do you want it, Clover?" She asked, and Clover nodded, she would let them do anything to her if it just meant eeling this good. And so they put the leash on Clover.</p><p>Salt was holding it, and Pepper quickened the pace of the dildo, making Clover tense up and cry out in pleasure. Maybe she was a pillow princess, yes, but God she felt like she was on top of the earth.</p><p>It was great, wonderful, fucking fantastic. Pleasure coursing through her body continuously, it just got better when it began slamming into her sweet spot. Cries filled the room as Clover moaned loudly.</p><p>Salt and Pepper we're just enjoying the view, Salt with her hand in her pants, masturbating. Every now and then she'd tug the leash just to watch Clover jerk and moan out whatever jamble of words she could think up.</p><p>Her mind was mush, her moans getting higher in pitch as she squirmed. She was getting close and they both knew that. She gasped out whatever indecipherable words that came to mind as she came all over the dildo.</p><p>"Guh,," Clover whined as she looked at Salt, who was bent over trying to get herself off, while Pepper looked satisfied with the outcome. "Oh, hun. We aren't done yet." She mumbled.</p><p>And before she could think up a word in her mush-brain, she gasped as she felt immediate vibrations. "nGH!" She moaned, bucking her hips and squirming uncontrollably.</p><p>"M-Mh! Pepper I-!" Clover practically screamed as the overwhelming feeling of overstimulation washed throughout her body. "Salt!" She gasped out, moaning and whining as loud as she could.</p><p>Salt was still rubbing her slit quickly, herself hunched over the bed as she tugged on the leash and moaned from touching her sensitive bud. Gasping and panting as she neared her orgasm.</p><p>Everything was a blur, the tears in her eyes slipping down from the pleasure, and he thighs quivering, body writhing, back arching- everything was just becoming too much for her and she just couldn't-</p><p>"Mommy!" Clover yelled as she came once more, Salt following not so long after with her face buried in the bed. Pepper looked between the both of them. "You guys..alright? Maybe I went to far with Clover but.."</p><p>"Yes!" Clover shouted, face flushed and eyes blown wide. "God, yes. Oh my god, that was..amazing." She quickly said, looking at Pepper with a satisfied look. "You we're both amazing, actually." She mumbled.</p><p>Salt sat up, pulling her hand from the inside of her jeans. "Fuuck, I came." Salt muttered, looking at the other two. "Maybe we should untie Clover now." Salt said, and Pepper chuckled and agreed.</p><p>She untied the belt and set Clover's poor wrists free, it was then that Salt brought up somthing both her and Clover would consider absolutely important. "Did Pepper cum?" She asked.</p><p>Clovee shrugged and looked at Pepper, who shook her head. "No, why?" She simply replied, then she noticed the way Clover and Salt looked at one another, then back at Pepper again.</p><p>Oh.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
