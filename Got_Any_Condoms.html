<h2 class="toc-heading">Got Any Condoms?</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Hey Trophy, got any condoms?”</p><p>Trophy turned to his open bedroom door and let out a resoundingly confused “What?” followed by a bewildered look in the voice’s direction. It belonged to no other than Knife, his previous rival and now hotelmate.</p><p>“You got a rubber or not? Come on, I don’t have all night.” Knife leaned nonchalantly against the doorframe as he awaited a response.</p><p>“Why would I even- Wait, what do YOU want with condoms?” Trophy asked as he turned his entire body around and crossed his arms. “There is no way someone like you is getting any action.”</p><p>Knife rolled his eyes in response, entering the room pushing past Trophy as he opened the drawers of the award’s nightstand.</p><p>“You know I said that same thing to myself about you, but decided to give you the benefit of a doubt.” Knife sighed as he finished rummaging around and shut the drawers.</p><p>“Looks like I was wrong though. Let’s hope Tissues is busier than you are.”</p><p>Trophy’s eye twitched at the audacity to go through HIS things, all while making assumptions based on his sex life. And all because he didn’t have condoms? What a prick. Of course, the award would never admit that Knife was *correct* in his assumptions. After all, it felt better to both mentally and physically deny it.</p><p>“Oh yeah? Well, unlike a loser like you, I don’t even NEED condoms! Never used any and never will!” Trophy jabbed a thumb towards his chest as though this statement were some sort of great proclamation. Knife certainly didn’t see it as such.</p><p>“Seriously? If that’s true I’d hate to see a bunch of little Trophys running around.” He snickered, already catching on to Trophy’s blatant lies. Knife paused from where he had begun to open up Tissue’s drawers, turning to look over his shoulder at the other.</p><p>“If you’re a virgin you can just say it. I won’t judge you.”</p><p>Trophy let out a disgusted gasp. “I am NOT a virgin!”</p><p>“Fine, what’s your body count then?”</p><p>“Easy! Twelve!” Was that too high? Trophy honestly wasn’t sure.</p><p>“Name three of them.”</p><p>Trophy went silent, blankly staring. He brought a hand to his chin and began rubbing as he stammered trying to think of names. Should he say someone in the hotel? He could, but that would leave room for Knife to question them. The last thing he wanted was for someone to be spreading gossip of his lies about fucking the hotel residents.</p><p>Knife grinned at Trophy. This guy was such a lost cause when he was backed into a corner. He glanced up at the clock. The gears in his mind turned for a second as he did some calculations, then sighed and shrugged with that stupid grin still plastered on his face.</p><p>“Tell you what. How about I just show you what it’s like. Then you don’t gotta go lying to people about not being a virgin.”</p><p>Trophy sat there with his eyes wide and mouth agape. Hearing an offer like that come from Knife of all people was the biggest surprise he could have ever received. And of course, he was considering it.</p><p>“Like.. me and you? In here?”</p><p>“Right here, right now. Whaddya say?”</p><p>Trophy blinked for a moment in silence. What did he have to lose? Other than his virginity. His dignity, he guessed. Buttttt on the other hand, he really did hate being a virgin. Besides, Knife was a pretty good looking guy, and if he were asking for condoms in the first place he had to know what he was doing.</p><p>Finally giving a sigh of resignation, Trophy began to climb onto the bed.</p><p>“Fine. But this better be worth it, chump.”</p><p> </p><p>Knife clicked his tongue as he looked down at the award beneath him. He laid there nonchalantly, arms folded behind his head and legs spread. His slit wasn’t even coaxed out, for fucks sake.</p><p>“Well? I’m waiting. Let’s get this over with so I can get on with my night.”</p><p>The other almost laughed a bit under his breath as he looked over his body. The two didn’t have any condoms and Trophy was a hopeless idiot, so he’d just have to take things in stride tonight.</p><p>“Don’t you have any sense of foreplay? Fine. I guess I’ll just have to do everything myself.”</p><p>Knife suddenly leaned in, placing a hand on Trophy chin.</p><p>“So be good and do as I say, alright?”</p><p>Suddenly unwrapping his arms, Trophy gazed up at Knife and silently nodded. That commanding voice did something to him- made him feel strange.</p><p>As he leaned back, Knife gave a satisfied look in response to Trophy’s answer. Then, to Trophy’s surprise, he snagged his waist with both hands and pulled him up into a rough kiss. The award let out a slightly disgusted sounding noise before quickly succumbing to his advances. Despite what he expected, Knife’s lips were warm and pleasing to the touch, a bit chapped but strong and firm. Kissing him was odd, but at the same time made butterflies begin to flutter in his stomach.</p><p>Noises of discontent turned into that of gentle hums into Knife’s mouth as their lips moved in sync. It wasn’t long before Trophy cracked his lips open a bit, hoping to coax Knife inside. The other silently agreed, and the two began a sloppy make out session. Knife’s tongue explored Trophy’s mouth and began to intertwine with his tongue, sending sparks of electricity up Trophy’s spine. By the time Knife pulled back to allow them both some air, a thin trail of saliva still connected them as Trophy gasped and panted. Knife gave a satisfied look as he took in the other’s expression.</p><p>“Not bad, huh?”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Trophy suddenly grabbed Knife’s midsection and pulled him down, causing the two to crash onto the bed. Trophy wrapped his legs around his waist as he reconnected their lips, chasing the warmth of the other’s kiss once more. Knife’s hands traveled up and down Trophy’s body, caressing his thigh or feeling the curvature of his chest. It wasn’t long before his hand snaked down to his lower half, running his fingers gently across the bottom side of his base. Trophy reluctantly let out a few sighs into Knife’s mouth as he felt the warm digits brush against the sensitive area. Soon enough his slit had been coaxed out, already slick and dripping. Knife rubbed at the entrance gently, going over it with his fingers in an agonizingly slow motion until Trophy’s tentacle revealed itself as well.</p><p>The weapon pulled back, admiring the sight beneath him as the other trembled, gasping for air and shivering from the cold of the room as it hit his now slick inner thighs. Trophy’s legs trembled as his gaze shifted between Knife and his own tentacle, writhing with desperation as his slit dripped with anticipation. God, he was nervous. The way Knife’s gaze bore into him did nothing to soothe the butterflies in his stomach. He could feel the warmth pooling into his lower half and traveling up the base of his cock, leaking out into liquid need that ran down his tentacle and coated it with slickness. Knife smiled a bit; he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t enjoying the view. Trophy’s anxiety couldn’t overtake his neediness in the moment. He glanced away as Knife made eye contact with him.</p><p>“Oh yeah, go ahead and take it allll in. Are we gonna do this or what? I don’t have the patience to just sit here while you gawk at me.”</p><p>Knife made a small grunt and brought a hand forward, grabbing Trophy’s head and turning his face to look up at him. The award gazed up in surprise.</p><p>“Is that any way to talk to me when I’m the one doing you a favor?”</p><p>Knife suddenly lowered his other hand to Trophy’s slit, inserting a finger.</p><p>“Maybe you should be thanking me instead.”</p><p>Trophy gasped at the sudden intrusion, squirming as he felt Knife’s finger begin to explore. The feeling was foreign, yet he didn’t hate it at all. His walls clenched around Knife, a small sigh escaping Trophy’s lips as he grew accustomed to the sensation.</p><p>“Come on, I asked you to speak.”</p><p>Knife quickly inserted another finger, grinning at how Trophy’s leg twitched in response before beginning to make a scissoring motion.</p><p>“Ah- thank… you…”</p><p>As much as he hated giving Knife the satisfaction, Trophy had to admit something hadn’t even known was inside of him enjoyed his own submission. He let out a slew of whimpers as he felt his walls being stretched. Slick coated Knife’s fingers, allowing them to slide in and out with ease. It wasn’t long before he entered a third, beginning to pump into the award with more force. Trophy threw his head back and bit his lip, sweat beginning to form on his forehead as the rhythm of Knife’s pumps coursed through his core.</p><p>“Ohhhh fuck…” Trophy’s hands clutched the bedsheets as he rode out the sweet, sweet pleasure assaulting his insides. It never felt this good when he touched himself. Maybe having another person do it was more important than he thought. Unfortunately, he didn’t get to enjoy the new sensation long as Knife retracted his fingers from his entrance, spreading them apart as he admired the slick that now coated them.</p><p>“You got into that faster than I thought. You really wanted it, didn’t you?” Knife asked smugly as Trophy caught his breath, groaning from the lack of stimulation as the good feelings faded. As much as Knife wanted to teach the bastard a lesson, he also enjoyed seeing him so worked up just by his touch. Something about him being knocked down a peg in the bedroom was more than satisfying.</p><p>“Ngh.. why’d you stop?” Trophy asked through an annoyed yet half lidded expression.</p><p>“I’m not here to just get you off and call it a night. You said you wanted to lose your virginity, so I plan to go all the way.”</p><p>Trophy was confused what Knife meant by that until he felt a hand lift up one of his legs, spreading them apart slightly. Knife lurched forward, pressing the tip of his tentacle against Trophy’s needy entrance. A trail of slick ran down from it as he felt a small spark of pleasure where Knife’s cock just barely prodded against him. His tentacle began to writhe in response. Oh fuck, he needed it. Forget his fingers, he needed Knife inside him immediately.</p><p>“What are you waiting for? Put it in.” Trophy let out needily, squirming in Knife’s grasp.</p><p>“Well I was just thinking..”</p><p>Knife leaned in, nearly brushing his lips against the side of Trophy’s face. His voice lowered to that of a sultry growl.</p><p>“I’d like it if you begged for it first.”</p><p>Trophy should have expected Knife to be a kinky motherfucker. That, or he was just trying to take his revenge for the earlier parts of their “friendship.” Not that any of that mattered now. Trophy bit his lip and huffed defiantly before casting his gaze to the side.</p><p>“Please. I need it.”</p><p>“Look at me.”</p><p>Trophy squeezed his eyes shut in annoyance before gazing up at Knife. He somehow looked even more attractive with those half lidded eyes. Fuck- fine. If he wanted him to beg, he’d beg. Trophy raised his hands and held the sides of Knife’s face, taking Knife by surprise.</p><p>“Fuck me, please… I need you so badly Knife. Don’t make me wait another second without the feeling of you inside of me.”</p><p>Knife’s tentacle dripped pre onto Trophy’s entrance in response. He knew he had asked him to beg, but hearing him word it like that made his cock throb with overwhelming desire. Giving in to Trophy’s and his own lust, he began to push inside the other’s soaking wet entrance. Knife groaned as he felt the tightness of Trophy’s virgin walls. The award let out a hiss of pain, moving his hands to dig his fingers into the bedsheets.</p><p>“Do you want me to-“</p><p>“Fuck no, keep going.”</p><p>Knife nodded and readjusted his body, pulling out before beginning to thrust back in once more. Despite Trophy’s enthusiasm he knew he had to start slow. As much as he could begin to hate the guy, he didn’t want to hurt him, especially not during something so important to him. He deserved to have a good first time, at the very least.</p><p>Trophy fidgeted beneath Knife, spreading his legs slightly more to allow Knife all the room he needed. Feeling the heat of his body radiating onto his most sensitive parts and the feeling of Knife’s girth felt heavenly in tandem with each other. He could handle a little pain, especially since he could feel a dull sense of pleasure rising inside of him, getting stronger with each thrust. He knew soon enough the hurting would subside, and decided to relax himself as much as he could.</p><p>Within a few minutes Knife began to thrust deeper, burying more of his cock inside of Trophy with each thrust. He could feel every inch of his desperate cock being squeezed, and god did he love it. Trophy’s walls were incredibly soft, and felt amazing when wrapped around his cock. The tight wetness coupled with Trophy’s moans made him overwhelmingly hot. Trophy’s slick coated his tentacle, allowing it to slip in and out with ease the more he thrusted back into him. Before long, he was slamming the entirety of his length as deep as it could go.</p><p>At this point Trophy had completely lost all sense of pain, replaced by white hot pleasure that made his head feel fuzzy. He had never reached this deep when masturbating, but he knew now his own fingers would never satisfy him like this. It was when Knife hit a particularly tight spot deep inside him that he screamed out his name, throwing his head back into the pillows. Knife took care to focus on this spot, the tip of his cock kissing Trophy’s cervix with each thrust.</p><p>Trophy felt like he was in heaven. His cock throbbed, wanting desperately to spill his cum. He tried his best to hold himself back, knowing how much better it would feel if he did. Still, at this rate, he wasn’t sure how much longer he could take it. Knife’s pace and strength did wonders to both pleasure him and push him towards the edge, threatening to send him over with each slam of his hips. Knife could feel himself getting close as well, sweat dripping from his forehead as the two rocked the bed. Trophy’s moans at this point had become loud and proud, with little regard for another hotelmate hearing them. He didn’t care anymore. All he wanted now was for Knife to make him-</p><p>“Knife- fuck, I’m-!”</p><p>Trophy wasn’t able to finish his sentence as he suddenly gasped, his hands clutching into the sheets as he felt his walls tighten and white hot pleasure begin to course through his cock. His juices simultaneously spurted from his tentacle and flowed from his slit, coating Knife’s cock. Knife swore as he felt Trophy’s walls practically crushing his tentacle in a vice grip. He brought a hand down over Trophy’s head to stabilize himself as he could no longer control himself, feeling his orgasm hit him hard. Trophy’s eyes rolled to the back of his head as he felt warm, thick love begin to fill his aching womb. God, it was hot. The way Knife’s cock twitched inside him and filled him up did something to him, something that didn’t make him angry at Knife for cumming inside at all.</p><p>Letting out a long, sultry moan, Trophy shuddered as he felt Knife pull out, feeling empty without his girth filling him. He could still feel Knife’s warm cum inside him. Whether Knife did it on purpose or not didn’t matter; he loved it. The weapon let out a sigh as he pulled out, looking down at the mess he had made of Trophy. Their breathing was ragged and out of sync as they caught their breaths, chests heaving as sweat dripped from their foreheads and on the bedsheets. Knife would be lying if he said he didn’t think Trophy looked handsome like this.</p><p>After a minute of silence and bliss between the two, Knife spoke.</p><p>“Was that.. good?”</p><p>Trophy gave Knife a look that just screamed “you just fucked my brains out and you’re asking if I liked it?” Knife shook his head and laughed a bit in response, shuffling back from Trophy to give him some space. The award pulled himself up from where he was lying down, feeling his entire body still burning with heat. His eyes closed for a second as if he were thinking, then suddenly he moved forward and pushed Knife down onto the bed, hovering over him while still breathing heavily. His eyes were half lidded and clouded with lust.</p><p>“Let’s go again.”</p><p>Knife looked up in surprise.</p><p>“After all that you wanna go again?”</p><p>“Heh. I’m a jock. I can handle more than one measly round. But if you’re not up for it-“</p><p>“No, I’m down.”</p><p>Knife grinned, his eyes also half lidded and reflecting Trophy’s lust.</p><p>“But don’t go crying if you can’t handle it. I could do this for hours.”</p><p>Trophy face had a look of enthusiasm as he brought his hips to align with Knife’s, teasingly bringing the tip of his cock to his entrance. He purred as he felt Knife’s cock harden, beginning to writhe with need as it dripped. Trophy licked his lips as he slowly lowered himself onto it, letting out a moan and a drawn out “fuck yes~” as he felt it enter him. Knife let out a groan of his own in response, bringing his hands up to wrap around Trophy’s waist and guide him.</p><p>Within a moments notice Trophy was already beginning to find a rhythm, starting slowly as he bounced up and down Knife’s cock. It hadn’t been long, but he had already been starting to miss the feeling of Knife inside him. Knife quietly chastised the fact he’d have to rediscover Trophy sweet spot at this angle, but otherwise found himself up to the task of exploring the other’s body as he helped bring Trophy’s hips up and down. As the award began to go faster, Knife suddenly tightened his grip on his hips and slammed him down with considerable force. Trophy yelped, but soon enough let out a cry of pleasure as Knife buried himself all the way inside.</p><p>Trophy bounced up and down on his cock, his eyes squeezed shut as he whimpered. His mind was foggy, and all he could think about was the feeling of Knife releasing inside him. He wanted to be filled until he couldn’t take anymore- fucked until he couldn’t walk.</p><p>“I-I need it so bad, Knife~”</p><p>Knife’s breathing was shallow as he attempted to keep up with the overwhelming pleasure he felt as Trophy’s hips slammed down on his cock. He’d never had a partner who matched his stamina so easily. Guess that was one of the perks of Trophy being a jock. Maybe that’s why he enjoyed this so much; seeing an overly proud and annoying son of a bitch reduced to nothing but pure pleasure by his hands was more than enough to make him want to take him over and over. Just seeing Trophy’s face now was fuel to light a fire of lust and passion within him.</p><p>Trophy gasped as he felt Knife suddenly grab him and flip him over, slamming him roughly into the bedsheets. He opened his eyes and got a good look at the glint of passion in Knife’s eyes before he felt him spread his legs, then slam his cock back inside with considerable force. Trophy moaned out, loving just how dominating Knife had become. Trophy’s voice pitched up as he suddenly felt Knife grab both his handles, using them as leverage as he increased the strength of his thrusts. He let out sobs of pleasure in return, screaming out “yes” and expletives over and over. His walls were aching, and he could feel the knot in his stomach begin to untie all over again. Best of all, he could feel Knife’s cock throbbing inside him, signifying his approaching orgasm.</p><p>Trophy’s legs tightened around Knife’s waist, practically begging him to cum inside once more. His legs twitched with anticipation as he felt his walls tighten. “Oh fuck- Knife I’m cumming!”</p><p>Knife’s grip on his handles tightened as his thrust became more sloppy, his orgasm heavy approaching. This time, he would spare no hesitation unloading another thick load inside of his partner. He suddenly let go of Trophy’s handles and cupped the award’s face, pulling him forward into a deep, passion filled kiss as he pinned him to the bed. Trophy let out a long, pleasured moan into the other’s mouth as he came, his eyes fluttering closed as he felt the familiar feeling of throbbing and warmth beginning to spread through his insides. The feeling of Knife cumming inside was like a drug to him; he just couldn’t get enough.</p><p>No, not just that. Knife himself had become a drug. And tonight, he planned to live out his addiction to the fullest.</p><p>Unfortunately, things had to settle down eventually and, after a few more rounds, settle down they did. Trophy and Knife laid together in the bed, an arm laid over Trophy’s head as he breathed heavily, his body still twitching every so often as he came down from his high and succumbed to exhaustion. Knife faired slightly better, also being exhausted but still having the energy to sit up and cross his arms behind his head as he took deep breaths. The two of them had ended things more than satisfied, maybe even having overdone it just a bit. Knife turned on his side, leaning his head on his fist as he looked at Trophy.</p><p>“So, pretty good for a first time, right? Any complaints Mr. No Condoms?”</p><p>Trophy uncovered his eyes just enough to shoot an annoyed glare at Knife, then sighed and brought both his arms down.</p><p>“Fine. I’ll admit it. That was pretty great. It was too bad we didn’t have any condoms though.” Trophy blushed a bit as he glanced away, feeling the warmth still pooled and leaking from between his legs where Knife had used him as a personal cum slut. Now that he thought about it, if he did have condoms, would Knife ever have offered to do this in the first place? Hopefully so, because tonight had been just too good to miss. Maybe he’d be open to doing it all again sometime. Maybe even condomless…</p><p>Knife rubbed the back of his neck with a chuckle. “Yeah, I kinda forgot about them by the second or third round. Guess I’ll have to get up early and grab some pills for you. Or we could just let it be and see what happens. Whatever works for you.”</p><p>Trophy laughed and turned on his side to look at Knife, mirroring the others stance.</p><p>“I thought you said you didn’t wanna see a bunch of little me’s running around?”</p><p>Knife gave an amused grin in response, pulling Trophy close and pecking him on the cheek.</p><p>“Eh, it’s different when they’re your little trophys.”</p>
