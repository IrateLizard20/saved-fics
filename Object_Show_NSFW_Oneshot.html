<div class="userstuff">
<p>(Read at your discretion. Mostly general, passionate vanilla sex in this chapter. Alright, here goes it)</p><p>¬†</p><p>It was a temperate summer day on the island, not blisteringly hot but warm enough to take a hike or go for a swim on the beach. Today was quite the lazy one too - it was business as usual, and everybody was going about their daily lives. The seagulls honked, the waves crashed ever so gently, and the flora danced with the rhythms of the light breeze. And MePhone even created pic-nix tables that generate any piece of food on a whim! No wonder he's such a fat slob; this place is luxury!</p><p>¬†</p><p>But not everyone had plans to indulge in relaxation. While Clover was out frolicking with the butterflies, Cabby was diligently researching the psychology of her teammates, and Lifering was out educating the others about proper CPR training, even though he looked like a complete tool doing it), Silver Spoon on the other hand wasn't feeling like his dignified self. He felt as if an affliction bedeviled him, but the feeling wasn't *a w f u l*. It felt like somebody was lightly punching his insides, and he yearned to know why.</p><p>¬†</p><p>And among further information, Spoon could pinpoint the culprit.</p><p>¬†</p><p>The piece of silverware gazed at Candle blankly as he witnessed her meditating near the Calm Down Cabana. Her serenity, her ability to stay collected, her carefree demeanor, and her sexy voice made Silver Spoon want just to take Candle by the arms and just go to town on her.</p><p>¬†</p><p>But he was apprehensive. How would such a barbaric act play out with the others? He has a reputation to defend; the savage plebians must know that he is on top, and sex would only make him, eugh, o r d i n a r y. Just the thought of being alongside the indigent made him want to hurl. But Candle, she was... different. She was elegant in her own right...</p><p>¬†</p><p>This indecisive thought pattern cycled in his head for a few more minutes until he just went with his gut and just decided to go for it. He motioned over to Candle, who was in a lotus position with eyes closed like normal and decided to start some banter.</p><p>¬†</p><p>"Why, hello there, beautiful. What's a pretty lady like you doing here all alone?"</p><p>¬†</p><p>Candle opened one eye and smiled. "So that's what my chakras were detecting. Greetings Silver Spoon, how are you on this lovely day?" She replied, still meditating. "I was just taking a nice midday stroll, and my my, the view is just divine~," Spoon flirted. Candle took the hint and started to chuckle.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Her laugh is so cute and sexy; all I want is just to bend her over right here and be my little cumslut. No, no, no, contain yourself, Spoon. You don't want to come off too strong. This isn't some wench; this is a lady," he thought to himself during the initial conversation.</p><p>¬†</p><p>"What a charming compliment, thank you," she said, looking into Spoon's eyes. Little did he know, but Candle also had quite a bit of a crush on Silver Spoon as well. He was tall, lean, and quite the socialite, which were the prime attributes of men she'd be down to date (and maybe even fuck). The arrogance she could live without, but hey, people change, right?</p><p>¬†</p><p>"Well, well, anything for the darling that deserves it. Is your day going swimmingly, my dear?" Candle, completely oblivious towards what was about to go down, answered his question as honestly as she could. "Well, it's fine. I'm sensing that the rest of the day will be nothing out of the ordinary," rubbing her temples in the process.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Unsure of how Silver Spoon would propose a hookup, he tried to incite the sexual spark in a controlled manner. "Well, my sweet, I have nothing planned for today. Is there anything I can do to satisfy your heart? Such a lovely girl shouldn't suffer the dishonor of feeling neutral..." he stared longingly into Candle's sweet eyes.</p><p>¬†</p><p>At this moment, Candle finally realized the goal that Silver Spoon was trying to achieve. The look on his face, his deviating body language, the very slight bump in his pants-- she felt stupid for not noticing it earlier. He wants to get down BAD.</p><p>¬†</p><p>As Candle began to get up from her regular meditation routine, she started to blush, the shades of purple mixing seamlessly into the shades of red forming around her cheeks. Eager to please, she replied seductively: "Well well well, if all you wanted was to, ahem... 'release some energy,' all you could've done was ask directly, silly~." She chuckled with a sexy twist, walking over to the shocked Spoon, twiddling her fingers in a circle around his torso.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Silver Spoon was utterly speechless. He stammered at his words, eyes moving left and right as his mind tried its very hardest to process that his sexual fantasies with Candle might indeed happen. "Uh, uhm, umm, heh heh, e-eager, aren't you? I-I like that." Candle circled the flustered guy. Staring at the tent Silver Spoon pitched in his pants, Candle was impressed by its size. "I could say the same about you too~, "she replied, pointing at his fully erect concealed penis.</p><p>¬†</p><p>"Oh, hoo hoo, w-well, I hope it isn't much of a bother; I actually feel kinda silly now that the feelings are reciprocated and MMPF--". Candle interrupted Silver Spoon's ramblings with a long, tender kiss. He was definitely taken aback by such a move, but he eventually closed his eyes and melted into the kiss as they gripped each other's hands tightly. The two were in utter bliss, lips soft as clouds as their tongues began to dance with each other. Silver Spoon's hands reached Candle's waist, and Candle's hands began to reach over his shoulders.</p><p>¬†</p><p>The two finally broke the kiss as their lips needed a break. Their faces were blushing a bright rosy red hue as both lovers looked away from each other, nervous about what was to come next. Silver Spoon decided to break the awkward silence. "Want to go into the Calm Down Cabana with me and... calm down? "You read my mind," Candle said eagerly as she offered her hand to Spoon, walking into the cabana.</p><p>¬†</p><p>"Let's cool off~," Candle said seductively as she slowly began to striptease for the horny Spoon. She fumbled with her shirt first and then her pants, revealing her smooth bare stomach and her purple bra and panties. Silver Spoon was loving every second of this; he couldn't wait to grip that body and those voluptuous D-cup breasts. After she undid her bra, she unzipped his pants to reveal a full-mast, meaty cock. She licked her lips in painstaking anticipation. "Are you ready, my love?" Silver Spoon questioned as he took off his shirt. Candle nodded quickly, laying down on the couch inside the cabana. She adjusted her position, wrapping her legs around his waist, and the foreplay began.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Silver Spoon began to lightly caress Candle's belly before motioning his hands up to her breasts. and fondled them ever so gently. "Mmm~," Candle moaned sensually, enjoying the buildup. She began to grasp his penis, rubbing it up and down slowly but rhythmically. The heat in the room began to intensify as their breathing got louder and their moans were more frequent. "Oh, fuck~," Spoon whispered at the euphoric state of Candle's soft handjob.</p><p>¬†</p><p>The foreplay was cyclical for a few minutes: Candle slowly stroking Spoon's cock, Spoon playing with her body like putty. It was like artwork: a single fleeting moment in time, impact preserved like a snapshot. Both lovers engaged in flirtatious and even sexual behavior before, but the synergy in this session was definitely something to behold. "Oh fuck, you know how to work me~," Candle wailed, her nipples pointy as the tip of a pencil. Silver Spoon's dick had a bit of precum leaking on the top of its shaft, his moans just as powerful.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Silver Spoon then went off of Candle's body. "Aw, why'd you stop?~" Candle groaned. "It's pretty simple, my delicate little flower. We're not done yet~," he smiled devilishly as he went on his knees, reaching for Candle's panties. "That is if you're ready." Candle looked down at him, still laying down on her back, and smiled. "Yes, I am ready. Fuck me. Fuck me like a wild animal, Spoon!" Candle insisted, her flame burning ever so brightly. "You will not regret this, darling~," Spoon chuckled as he slowly took off Candle's panties, showcasing her wet, needy vagina.</p><p>¬†</p><p>She once again wrapped her legs around his back, and he began to adjust his penis to begin penetration. "I'll ask again. Ready?" "Just put it in, you handsome fancy boy~." As soon as Spoon's penis entered Candle's pussy, Candle shrieked in pleasure and covered her mouth. "Do not be alarmed. I want to hear you scream so loud the world will hear." Spoon's thrusting was slow but ramped up in speed relatively quickly as both lovers got used to the heavenly feeling. "Oooohhhhh, so wet and tight~," Spoon groaned as his stomach was tied up in knots, love overtaking himself. Candle's boobs began jiggling hypnotically, the sight only adding more lust to the sex stew. Both lovers' breaths began to sync up with one another as Spoon's thrusting began to create a steady rhythm. His dick, doused in precum, and Candle's sopping wet pussy acted as a nice lubricant, allowing Spoon to speed up his powerful thrusts.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Minutes into sex, things began to intensify. "Ohhhh, fuck me harder, fuck me harder!!!" Candle yelled. Spoon, a bit shocked to see the soft-spoken lady speak in such a way, fulfilled her wishes, gradually increasing the tempo of the symphony going on in the Calm Down Cabana. The sound of Spoon's penis pounding against her flower began to create a sticky, moist sound (you know the one). Both lovers, moaning almost every second, tried to turn each other on verbally. "W-who's my little s-slut? Who's m-my dirty bitch?~" Spoon began to demand as the intense thrusting made his sentences choppy. "I am! I am!" Candle howled in desire, moans in between every word. "Oh, I l-love this s-so much. I love y-you so much~," Candle whimpered. The declaration of love didn't make things easy to last much longer, however.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Nine minutes into first contact, Spoon could barely hold it in for much longer. A bubble of cum was forming at the tip of his shaft. "I'm a-a-lmost there, sweetie... Tell me w-w-here you w-want me to cum," he said. "Mmmmm, cum on my body. I want you to paint my blank canvas, baby~." That enough could've been enough to blow his load then and there; the fact he lasted this long was a miracle in its own right. Hearts pounding, Silver Spoon took his last few thrusts before pulling out, jerking off for the last few seconds. "H-h-here it comes...," he said quickly as his entire body was shaking. Candle couldn't wait, "Mmmm, yes, let it all out baby!~"</p><p>¬†</p><p>Silver Spoon and Candle climaxed in sync, her fluids drenching the couch, and his thick, viscous cum began to spurt out rhythmically across her belly, some of it even pooling into her deep belly button. Jerking off until the last few drops of his sweet, sticky seed came out, he stopped, laying down on his knees as his body felt like it was eternally shutting down. Candle, her body now covered in cum, shuddered in bliss at the feeling of such a hot liquid flowing across her stomach. "Could you get me a towel, honey?" Candle asked politely, her hands squeezing her breasts. "Most certainly, darling~," Spoon replied, reaching for the box of tissues in the Cabana bathroom. He wiped her clean, and the two kissed for a few seconds before putting their clothes back on and eventually leaving the place.</p><p>¬†</p><p>In the distance, The Floor was at the floor of the Cabana, staring in horror like a widower at his wife's murder scene. It turns out he witnessed everything. "Welp, time to wash my eyes out in bleach..."</p>

<h2 class="heading">Tea Kettle x Lifering (NSFW)</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Two days passed. The Floor's incessant eavesdropping led him to spill the beans about how Silver Spoon and Candle had some good sex with each other in the Calm Down Cabana, which had to be thoroughly cleaned. He was furious, body seeping red from the circumstances. Oh, the humiliation by his teammates! He could barely contain his frustration, but how was Candle doing? The news didn't faze her at all. She was performing her normal daily meditation routines as if nothing happened. You would think that, as a newly established item, people would come to their own conclusions, or it would happen at some point; Floory just seemed to speed up the process.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lifering was near the outskirts of the island, discussing plans on how to save themselves from yet another demeaning loss.<br/>"The others may have costed us a couple wins, but I just know deep down that my ideas prosper! My optimism, alongside my helpful first aid and safety kit, stands no chance for failure! WE WILL CONQUER, SINKERS!" He yelled proudly as he paced around, pointer finger high in the air.</p><p>Tea Kettle was making some deviled eggs and corn muffins for Balloon and Nickel when she couldn't help but overhear Lifering's solo pep talk.¬†<em>Ugh, not this schmuck again. Is he annoying? Yes. Overly precautionary? You bet. A bit full of himself? Yep, he checks all the boxes; Lifer's a total mamaluke.</em></p><p><em>"</em>Save the kerfuffle and admit that you're too much of a coward to take any take risks. Playing the safe route can only get our team so far, ya know," TK scolded, her hands on her hips.</p><p>"AH! Oh, you scared me, TK. Food smells good. Is everything alright?"</p><p>"<em>Alright?¬†</em>What are you, meshuggah? You wish. First MePhone misinterprets our team name as a ripoff, I get humiliated on reality TV by a feature I already¬†<em>hate¬†</em>about myself already, and the annoying motivational garble is NOT GONNA BRING US OUT OF THE WOODS THIS TIME!</p><p>"I may have done some things I'm not proud o-"</p><p>"Ahbupbupbup, stop, stop right there. You need to just swallow your pride now, 'cause your days are numbered, bub, unless some miracle waltzes in here and changes my mind.<b>¬†You're on thin ice, Lifering</b>."</p><p>"TK, come back!¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† I'm... sorry..." The maternal figure walked out of Lifering's sight, back turned against him. "Oh my gosh, how do I bounce back? How will I prove to her that I am capable of being a good leader? She's right... It is MY DUTY, nay, MY CALLING to make things right with her. But how...?</p><p>Sunrise came at 6 AM the next day. Lifering woke up¬† in his bunkbed feeling groggy and empty inside as he was craving some bacon and sunny-side-up eggs at the Pic-Nix tables. He had a tough time sleeping, partly due to Yin-Yang's sleep fighting on the top bunk, but mainly because of how upset he was over the fight with Tea Kettle yesterday. He stayed up until 1:30 trying to think up of ideas on how to turn the tides of their friendship, which made it ever so difficult to be his determined self.</p><p>When he walked outside he thought he was in a wood-burning oven. The temperature of the island clocked in at 110 degrees, and the contestants were definitely not having any of it. Goo was all sticky, Cabby almost had to sit down due to early signs of heat stroke (she's made of metal, a good thermal conductor of heat), and Tea Kettle began to feel... bothered in this summer swelter. When she's burning up, her spout starts releasing steam, "changing" her behavior.</p><p>After hours of considerate planning, Lifering decided to drop the idea of making a plan to reconcile their relationship by apologizing from the heart. Unfortunately, she was nowhere to be found. He looked everywhere, from the highest cliffs, to the Calm Down Cabana, to the elimination area, he even considered going out past shore, but his efforts were to no avail.</p><p>After looking for twenty minutes, he heard Tea Kettle's voice, or at least, he thought he did behind some shrubs. She sounded like she was groaning in pain, so Lifering quickly swung into action, his lifeguard instincts kicking in at full swing.</p><p>"TK, ARE YOU ALRIGHT?!?!"</p><p>Lifering found Tea Kettle alright. Little did he know that she wasn't in pain... she was masturbating.</p><p>"Oh my gosh, TK I'm so sorry! Please don't be mad, I thought you were in trouble! My mind thought you were being eaten by a wild animal or you got poison ivy or you were abducted by seagulls or‚Äî"</p><p>He was interrupted quickly. "Shhhhhh, it's alright honey. I forgive you for everything~" Tea Kettle said blissfully, blushing like mad while she put a hand on Lifering's arm.</p><p>"I'm not sure I understand," he spoke softly. The heat made TK soft and bubbly like putty, like she was hypnotized by the sudden heat spell. "I feel... bad for treating you so harshly. What do you say I make it all up to you so we can start over, hun~?" She uttered in an inviting tone. Lifering was taken aback by the kindness he was receiving; it was like he was talking to a completely different object, like Bow or Clover or Goo was the other end of the conversation.</p><p>Lifering definitely knew what was coming next. "W-what are you saying?" "I was thinking I'd give you the old, ahem," TK stated followed by a tugging up and down motion. "Oh... OHHHHHHH. U-u-um, if uh, if that's what you want I guess...," he said shyly, his eyes glued to the ground in embarrassment.</p><p>"It's not what I want, sweetie, it's what YOU want," she chuckled playfully as she reached for the hem of her shirt. A few seconds later, she let go. "Wait, I got an even BETTER idea," she cackled devilishly.</p><p>The two rushed into the Calm Down Cabana, and started making out for a few minutes. TK pulled back , initiating her master plan. She took off her shirt and removed her bra, revealing some impressive DD cup breasts. "Ever heard of something called¬†<em>paizuri</em>? I looked at my son's browser history on his phone, and I gotta say, I haven't seen something so intriguing since the dawn of new wave." Lifering stammered in utter anticipation. "N-no, I don't think s-so. What is it?"</p><p>"Oh you'll see. üòà"</p><p>Tea Kettle fumbled with Lifering's cargo shorts, revealing a moderately-sized penis at full mast. She then laid him down on a nearby chair, got on her knees and started to put his dick in between her soft breasts, and began "working" him.</p><p>Lifering immediately felt a surge of pleasure overcome him. It was clear TK was an expert at this.</p><p>"Mmh, holy m-moly." His mouth was clean as a whistle, unlike TK, who had the mouth of a sailor.</p><p>The boobjob was so good, his mouth was drooling. The hypnotic movement of her breasts moving up and down his hot, stiff shaft, and her loving smile melted his already warm heart.</p><p>"How are you so good at this?" Lifering asked. voice quivering from the pleasure. "A lady never tells~," she responded, her tits bobbing up and down. At times he would even grip her breasts and motion her to pull up and down for extra friction.</p><p>As time went on, Lifering's on Tea Kettle's shoulders began to tighten greatly as he was approaching ever so closer to releasing his "man-fluids" (as he called it)</p><p>"Golly, I'm gonna... finish, TK!" Lifering grunted, hands twitching in bliss as precum started to leak onto her chest. "C'mon, you can't hold it in for a few more seconds?" "U-ugh, I'll try my hardest, but n-no p-promises."</p><p>And the attempt was successful. TK tried to stop bobbing so she could hear more of his thankful moans, but she knew he couldn't last forever, so she finally gave in. "Alrighty hun, give it all you got~" she bit her lip in excitement.</p><p>Lifering's moans turned into primal groans at this point, thoughts seeping with love for this woman (and her heavenly "mountains.") TK took her final thrusts until he released his thick cum in between her breasts. He couldn't handle how the puddle of cum in between started to leak out onto her breasts.</p><p>Lifering grabbed a box of Kleenex and cleaned her up. When he was done, TK removed his penis from her tits and put her shirt back on. Lifering zipped up his cargo shorts.</p><p>"W-wow, that was truly an amazing experience," Lifering applauded, trying to catch his breath. Thank you for that, by the way." "I was glad to be a mensch. hun," she smiled endearingly at him. "There's one thing I want to tell you before I leave, though." Sure, what's that?"</p><p>"<b>If you're dumb enough to have the chutzpah to share what we did here today, you'll wish you were dead instead. Got it?"</b></p><p>Lifering pulled back in fear. "Y-yes ma'am. Can we do this again when you're feeling a bit... 'needy?'" TK nodded in approval. "Absolutely. But I'm watching you, Lifer. Don't test me," she insisted, performing the "I'm watching you" gesture.</p><p>Both islanders left the Calm Down Cabana, fortunately to no one else nearby. Cabby, however, took note of all the recent time everybody's been spending together. "Interesting. I wonder what is causing all these relations throughout the island populace...?" she questioned.</p>

</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was another beautiful day on the island‚Äî not a single cloud in the sky could be found. The contestants were taking advantage of such nice weather by partaking in marine activities. Yin-Yang was out fishing with Box, Paintbrush was playing volleyball with some of the Pinkers, Lifering was watching from a guard tower he seemed to build himself‚Äî everyone seemed to find solace in such a hectic season.</p><p>Well, mostly everyone. Being the antisocial, insecure dork he was, Fan was kinda pacing around the beach talking to himself about how he'd try and communicate with others. He was awful at it back in Season 2, speaking to management was a nightmare when he filed noise complaints back at Hotel OJ, and now? Well, he's okay, but his limits aren't necessarily lofty ones to put it lightly.</p><p>Ever since the day he saw Cabby's file about himself being an "impulsive shut-in," his confidence has reached an all-time low that brought Fan into an internal battle with his self-conscious, his self-esteem on the line.</p><p><em>Does her file make sense...? C'mon, it clearly doesn't; only a FOOL would think that </em>I¬†<em>of all people would even remotely be controlled by a lack thereof... Nah... no... she's right. I'm a mess. I'm a puny little loser with awful social skills. I only have¬†</em>one¬†<em>good friend, and¬†</em>SHE'S¬†<em>a loser too! I'll never get a girlfriend, and she's most likely appalled by the mere thought of love...</em></p><p><em>"</em>Aw, darn it," Fan said quietly in embarrassment. "I hope she wasn't around to hear that. Wait, where even is Test Tube?"</p><p>Fan then decided to spend the next few minutes of this outdoorsy day asking his teammates about Test Tube's whereabouts. Bow had no idea, Goo gave some cryptic inspirational message about how you have to find yourself before you find someone else, Clover was too invested in her butterfly friend to even answer Fan‚Äî it seemed like she was out of his range at the moment.</p><p>The poor guy was a bit torn on whether to give up and fall asleep or ask Cabby. After some deliberation he decided to just ask her outright; couldn't hurt to sink any lower than where he already was.</p><p>"Hey Cabby, do you know where Test Tube went? I'm kind of down in the dumps, and I wanted to see if she could give me any advice." "Greetings, Fan! Yes, I did witness Test Tube wander around approximately half a mile due east of our very spot. Would you like a map I have on file about the geography of this island? Physical, political, topographic?" Still a bit annoyed by her vast knowledge of everything under the sun, he responded quickly. "Uh no no, no need. Just tell me where east is and I'll leave you alone." "Alrighty! Safe travels Fan!" Cabby pointed to his left, Fan gave her his thanks and made his way to where Test Tube could possibly be.</p><p>About ten minutes later, Fan believed he had reached his destination. The part of the island he encountered was lush and filled with long, thick grasses and shrubs.¬†<em>This seems like a perfect getaway. I hope Test Tube's okay.</em></p><p>Fan started to scavenge the area hoping to find any trace of her. No sounds of scary gadgets or gizmos, none of her cute expressions of surprise, no indication that she was here. Fan began to think she got lost, or worse... until he heard a faint sigh not too far from where he was standing. He started to tiptoe closer to where he believed the sound was coming from: a row of tall, thick shrubbery. His heart pounding in fear that she was in danger, Fan's adrenaline surged through him as he went through the bush, but what he saw was definitely baffling.</p><p>He found Test Tube alright, but she wasn't in danger... she was... sleeping, perhaps?</p><p>"Uhmm. T-test Tube? Is everything alright?" She screamed, surprised that he found her. "GOLLY JEEPERS! H-how'd you find me here?"</p><p>"W-well, I was feeling a little lonely, and I was starting to have some dark thoughts, s-so I decided to come to you, because you're my best friend, and knowing how intelligent you are, you'd know how to help me. But you didn't seem to be anywhere, so I asked everybody on the team if either of them knew where you went, and nobody knew until Cabby pointed me in the right direction. But I found you, and I couldn't be happier to see you!" He said, walking over to Test Tube and hugging her.</p><p>"Aww, that's... really nice of you to say; I'm flattered, Fan. I'm totally okay, I just wanted to find a relatively secluded location and just relax away from the others. Say, what seems to be bothering you? You don't seem to exude your joyful oddball mannerisms lately," she said, putting her soft hand on his shoulders.</p><p>Fan sighed in relief, blushing slightly at the friendly response. "Oh good, I was worried about you. But yeah, ever since Cabby punished me for grabbing her file on me, I've been feeling pretty skeptical of my abilities. I have these doubts about what I've accomplished. I have doubts about who I am, who I want to be... it's something you don't understand," he grumbled, holding back tears.</p><p>Test Tube looked at Fan, head down at his lap, and just stared at his face.¬†<em>Golly, he looks... kinda cute when he's disheveled,¬†</em>she thought to himself, hoping he didn't hear her say such a thing.</p><p>The girl wanted nothing but for him to feel okay. "Aww, Fan, come here." Test Tube offered her arms out to him and gave him a big hug. "If you want, I can keep you company so you don't fall back into that deplorable mindset again. I'm worried about you, buddy...," she suggested with a reassuring smile on her face.</p><p>Fan was so thankful of Test Tube's generosity that his confidence came back swinging, so much so that he began seriously considering doing something drastic to show his appreciation for this girl. His crotch started to pulse in pleasure, and his dick slowly started to grow in size. At first, he was embarrassed, but the desire to please became uncontainable.</p><p>Fan, in a sudden burst of action, started to grab Test Tube by the waist and press his lips against hers. She was definitely taken aback by the action, stammering quickly in confusion. He quickly snapped back into reality, realizing what he had done.</p><p><em>Well, time to move to Siberia,</em>¬†he thought as he covered his face to hide his shame.</p><p>"F-f-Fan, uhhhmmm...," she said in long bursts, "I didn't say stop~."</p><p>Fan uncovered his face and sighed in relief. The fact that she enjoyed the kiss made him want to please even more so than before. He then continued the kiss, only this time Test Tube returned the kiss back with equal intensity. The two started to synchronize with each other, moaning together and whispering encouraging things in between breaths. Eventually, their tongues started to get in on the act, and they were equally in bliss as the passion between each other blossomed.</p><p>Fan then pinned Test Tube to the ground. "My my, so forceful~," she said gingerly. Fan was mostly a sub, but the adrenaline brought out a side of him that wanted to dominate, a side he was never familiar with until now.</p><p>He started to kiss the girl for a few more seconds before nibbling on her neck. This made her moan and giggle simultaneously, pleasing the horny Fan even more. Her skin was so soft and warm, the anticipation prompted Fan to see more of her.</p><p>Fan then moved down from her neck to her crotch area. He unzipped her pants, and with Test Tube's assistance, pulled them down to reveal a sexy pair of lime green panties. He grabbed her by the thighs and held them tightly as he fumbled with the panties and took them off gently. "W-w-wow," Fan said, mouth agape as he stared at her entrance.</p><p>"W-well, are you gonna do something with it, or am I gonna have to force you to go down there, hmm~?" She said with a chuckle, taunting Fan. "I'm not complaining, just admiring the view." He took his right hand and put two of his fingers inside of Test Tube, who instantly succumbed to the huge wave of pleasure coursing through her.</p><p>He had a blast hearing her sexy moans that his penis was throbbing, begging for some attention. Test Tube noticed this and unbuttoned Fan's jeans with ease, revealing his sheath of average length. She spit in her hand and began to slowly stroke his dick up and down, which was greatly appreciated by how pent-up he was.</p><p>What evolved into kissing evolved into steamy mutual masturbation, but Fan decided to go an extra step further two or three minutes afterward. He got himself up from his current stance and motioned his face closer to Test Tube's throbbing pussy. He looked up quickly for her permission, and she nodded.</p><p>Fan slid his tongue into her vagina and began to slowly lick her clitoris. At this point, Test Tube's prior moans transformed into borderline screams, but their discrete location saved them from the embarrassment of the public eye.</p><p>Fan enjoyed the sweet, sticky sensation so much that he sped up his pace. Test Tube, already overwhelmed with pleasure, drew closer to blacking out. To her, this felt better than getting an A in her old quantum physics course she took in college last year.</p><p>Fan grew a bit tired of the cunnilingus and began to return to fingering Test Tube. She was eager to work on his dick again. It felt weird, and it even looked weird, but it was a good kind of weird, similar to interacting with your best friend. Fan began to moan as Test Tube jerked him off gradually at a quicker pace.</p><p>A few minutes passed and it was evident that the two were close to reaching their breaking points. Their moans were faster and more intense. Their bodies started to shake vigorously. Fan's left hand began moving around Test Tube's body, almost like it had a mind of its own. He knew the end was seconds away. "Ungh, gon.. gonna cum, gonna cum!" He exclaimed quickly as he pulled her hand away and started to jerk himself off. She started to masturbate for a few seconds until quickly pulling her shirt all the way up above her boobs so Fan could finish without making a mess on her favorite green tee.</p><p>Seconds later, the two moaned at the top of his lungs as his seed drenched Test Tube's lower stomach little by little. "S-so... much~...," she uttered as she tried to catch her breath. When the last drop of cum came out, Test Tube put a finger on her belly and licked it clean, enjoying the salty taste. Fan was smitten.</p><p>"T-that was great, Testy. You know how to get me going~," Fan flirted as he started to massage her breasts gently.</p><p>"Mmm... s-shut up, nerd," she barked in an attempt to flirt with him. He laughed as he began to wonder how he'd clean up the mess he made, all the while going to town on her boobs.</p><p>"You know, I don't think there are tissues nearby. What if...," he said, moving his hands from her breasts to her bare waist, licking her belly clean the old-fashioned way.</p><p>"O-ohhh... this is certainly unorthodox, but not unwelcome~," she giggled as the feeling was ticklish but also pleasurable. Fan was a bit taken aback by the bitter taste of his semen, but the saltiness of Test Tube's skin made it all better.</p><p>After her stomach was given that special treatment, Fan gave her boobs a few more squeezes, then gave her a long, passionate kiss on the lips before finally putting their underwear and pants back on.</p><p>"Do you think we could go... all the way next time?" Test Tube pleaded.</p><p>"Absolutely," Fan responded, kissing her cheek. They walked back to where the others were relaxing, hand in hand.</p>

<h2 class="heading">Microphone X Knife (NSFW)</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>7:30 AM. The menacing sound of the alarm on Mic's phone meant one thing: it was time for her to get ready for yet another boring day at Costco for the umpteenth time. The reluctant look on her face was ever so obvious.</p><p>Mic's routine was in the ordinary‚Äîa bit too ordinary. Get up, brush her teeth, shower, comb and braid her hair, get dressed, eat breakfast, and leave. Working a 9 to 5 job was and still is her worst nightmare; fulfilling her dream of becoming a singer in a rock band was the goal for ages, but studying to become a financial analyst invaded her aspirations to actively look for such an opportunity, and during holidays, that time was spent with her family, whom she loved but had a bone to pick with at times. Summers were spent at a nearby apartment complex working odd jobs. "Man, what the hell happened?" She asked the barren hallway as she locked her door, ready to leave.</p><p>What Mic needed was some kind of a getaway. It didn't have to be a vacation per se‚Äîas long as she could find a way to escape the humdrum turn of normal life somehow, she could live her life to her full potential for once. Maybe her upscale parents would finally understand why she wasn't so "directionless" and "indolent." Perhaps her colleagues would realize that being loud and proud pays off. If only there was a way to prove that she could rock all the moves, that she had her shit together...</p><p>"Maybe I need a man," she questioned herself as she was just a few minutes away from Costco. "Someone who's a bit of a punk, but a guy with a huge heart. Yeah, that would fill the void. Oh,¬† definitely somebody who's good with the six-string; musicians are SOOOO hot. Am I bad for wanting a dude with money? Nah, I dunno...," she spoke out loud. As she pulled into the employee parking lot, she sighed, realizing that nobody in this town could possibly be all three. "Keep dreaming Mic, THAT's not gonna happen. You're gonna be stuck in this place forever. "</p><p>Her day was pretty much the same. Mic mostly worked the register, ringing up purchases of all kinds from people of all walks of life. She ran into a few kooks from time to time (a bald man in a tracksuit offered her ecstasy!), but largely the job was so brainless. She felt like a robot enslaved by corporate overlords.</p><p>At around 12:50 PM, an encounter with a certain gentleman turned the tables for Mic forever.</p><p>"Next," Mic said emotionless, totally ready to go on break soon. A low, raspy voice started to grace her ears. "Hey, how's it hanging?"</p><p>"I'm good, how are y‚Äî," Mic was cut off by the dreamboat that was gracing her presence.¬†<em>Early to mid-20s, black leather jacket and pants, band pins, mohawk!!!! I think I'm in love~, </em>Mic thought to herself as she started to chuckle at him, blush at full swing.</p><p>The man didn't seem to have the same feelings. "Okay now, what the hell's so funny?" He said in an agitated tone, stance widening. "Oh, no no no no no, I just... umm..." <em>What do I tell him, that I'm just into him? I'm at work, for God's sake!¬†</em>"...I was literally just thinking of a funny meme I saw the other day. The guy looked a lot like you."</p><p>"That's what I thought," replied the man. A wave of guilt flowed through his being, realizing what he had done. "Wait, what am I doing? You were just doing your job and here I am, borderline threatening you. I can't help it; I'm trying to work on my anger, but it just... slips out of my control sometimes. The bottom line is I'm sorry. Anything I can do to repay you?"</p><p>Mic was just staring blankly at his chiseled face that whole time, lost in his eyes. "Uhhhhh. I dunno...," she mumbled. "AW, SHOOT!" She realized that she accidentally charged the man $57 for his purchases instead of $37. And then she realized she screamed at the top of her lungs again, and her manager probably heard her yell.¬†<em>Today can't get any worse</em>, she thought to herself.</p><p>"Huh? Oh, don't worry about it. Tell ya what, fix the mistake, and that extra $20 could go right into your pocket, no questions asked." "Really? No, I couldn't," she chuckled, that blush still coming back. The man started to take notice of Mic's beauty and had another idea planned. "Please, I insist." He took $20 out of his jacket and a pad of paper. Without her looking, he quickly grabbed the pen on the desk and wrote his name and number on the sheet furiously quickly. "Here you are. Have a good day, uh, Microphone," he waved quickly as he took a peek at her nametag.</p><p>"You too," she said. Swooning at the hunk that stood before her, she was smitten for the first time since the tenth grade. As cool as that was, she still had a job to do, unfortunately. Mic recognized the piece of paper that was amongst the dollar bills and saw the information the man wrote while she wasn't looking. She squealed quietly in victory. "Knife, you sexy beast, you may be a way out of this rut!"</p><p>When she got home from work, Mic decided to send Knife a text and flirt with him, but it seemed like he beat her to it an hour before. The two started to have a long conversation about their deadbeat jobs, their favorite bands, their hopes, their dreams. The conversation was going well, but Mic decided to take a huge risk and developed the courage to ask him out on a date, and he said yes, deciding to meet up at Gelatin's Steakhouse Friday night at 7:30 PM, and she agreed.</p><p>In the meantime, Mic decided to go with her best friend (with benefits) Soap to buy her a cute new dress at the mall.</p><p>"Mic, check out this dress I picked out for you. Isn't it hot?" Soap was holding a laced black dress.</p><p>"I dunno, isn't that too much for a steak dinner?" Mic raised her eyebrow at the statement that was the dress.</p><p>"Nonsense, you must look clean for your boy toy! Dress to impress, they say!"¬†<em>I fucking hate that sing-song voice</em>, Mic thought as she rolled her eyes at Soap.</p><p>"Bestie, you wish. He probably wants to take it slow. And I bet he doesn't care about looks any more than I do. Have you seen him? He's totally not your type; he thinks NOTHING like you!"</p><p>"Just wear it! Come on, he'll love it and so will you!"</p><p>"If it'll get you off my back, fine. But JUST this once. If it's not gonna make me hot for you, it's definitely not gonna make him hot for me. Just saying. We're like the same person."</p><p>"Oh, hush. I know what I'm doing, and I know you better than you know yourself," Soap said with a devilish grin on her face.</p><p>Mic shook her head and bought the dress. "Bye money, I'll miss you...," she said quietly to herself at the cashier.</p><p>After a thorough one-and-a-half-hour cleaning, hair care, and makeup session later she left for Gelatin's. This car ride made her think more risqu√© thoughts about Knife.¬†<em>What does he look like with his shirt off? I bet he has a ripped bod! What does his...¬†</em>"Oh shut up Mic, don't go there!" She blushed, mad at herself for even considering having sex on the first date.</p><p>She entered the restaurant with a myriad of compliments from dudes and even a handful of women.</p><p>
<em>Don't you have tri-tips to eat? So god damn embarrassing...</em>
</p><p><em>"</em>Microphone! Over here!" Knife yelled, waving his hand in the air. She smiled and quickly motioned over to the table he reserved for each other.</p><p>"S-sorry I'm late. My friend insisted I dress up. I look pretty stupid, right?" Mic said embarrassingly.</p><p>Knife was utterly in awe that such a beautiful woman was unable to see what he saw. "Stupid is probably the complete opposite word I'd use; maybe killer or breathtaking, but if you wanna look stupid, you're wearing rags," Knife said with a smirk on his face.</p><p>Mic giggled into her hand. "So, what are you thinking of ordering?"</p><p>"Let's see... The New York Strip looks good... Salisbury too... the club sandwich doesn't make we wanna gag, uhhhhhhhh I think I'll go with the New York Strip. You?"</p><p>"I uh... think I'll just have a club sandwich and a salad. I'm on a bit of a diet. I'm so sick of tired of seeing all these thin-ass women eat anything they want and nothing happens to them! Meanwhile, I take a bite out of anything unhealthy and it all goes to my ass! You don't think I'm too curvy, right?"</p><p>Knife just kinda stared at her, useful as a rock. She was curvy alright, meaty even. She had to have DD's and a dump truck for an ass.</p><p>Knife was taken aback by this ludicrous statement. "What? You're definitely curvy, but don't let that bother you. Embrace it," he said, eyes darting towards her breasts.</p><p>"I wish I could. I got teased quite a bit in high school for my body by these thin girls, and it stuck with me ever since then." Mic stared at her salad as her appetite started to wane.</p><p>Knife empathized with her disappointment. "Eh, fuck those girls. They clearly don't see good taste and they're probably jealous that they didn't turn out to be such a strong woman like you. Telling it like it is, being large in charge. You're like the perfect person to me," Knife smiled warmly as he put his hand on hers.</p><p>Mic blushed at the touching comments. "I... I don't know what to say. Thank you so much, I needed that lately."</p><p>"No problem babe. You deserve it." Mic blushed at the nickname he gave her.</p><p>The rest of their dinner mainly consisted of small talk about college and music. It turns out that Knife has been playing guitar for a few years, and he knows a drummer, but the two would have to actively search for a bassist. During dessert, Mic had... other things she wanted to take care of first.</p><p>"So, Knife..." "Yeah?" He questioned, raising an eyebrow at the way Mic was clasping in hands like she was at a business meeting. "Do you wanna come back to my place and 'have some fun?' She then checked her nails with a smug smile on her face.</p><p>Knife blushed at how forward she was.</p><p>"U-uh, are you sure? I don't wanna rush‚Äî" He was cut by a warm finger on his lips.</p><p>"Hey now, don't worry about that! You got my consent, I'm just requesting for yours, silly."</p><p>Knife couldn't wrap his head around what might happen later tonight. "I-I mean, if you're 100% sure you want this, I'll get down and dirty."</p><p>"Sounds good, sounds good. Let's get outta here."</p><p>Mic texted her address and apartment number to Knife and she left for home a few minutes after him so she could get ready and tidy her crappy room up. She dimmed the lights as fast as she could, lit a candle on her dresser, and put on something that was far more casual.</p><p>As the minutes quickly passed, Mic heard two knocks on her door. "*gasp* It's go time." She took a deep breath and cleared her throat.</p><p>She opened the door to see Knife blushing a deep red on his cheeks. "Well hey there, you hunk a slice of meat! You wanna take a few minutes to get situated or do you want to just get into the fun?~"</p><p>Knife, while still a bit of a hot mess, was far more confident this time around. "Well don't just stand there woman, to the bedroom!" He pointed hastily to a random door.</p><p>Mic laughed. "Dumbass, that's one of the closets, my bedroom's over there," she pointed at the door to the left of it. "I think you meant that one over there."</p><p>"Oh of course, how could I not have known?" Knife said sarcastically. "Let's just get started already." Mic shook her head playfully. "Alright, let's go, horny boy.~"</p><p>She walked into the bedroom, and Knife followed soon after. The two started to kiss passionately, Mic grabbing his chest, Knife grabbing her waist, with Mic on top. Their lips, dancing together in harmony, the synchronizing sounds of their moans, it felt natural for both of them. Not too long afterward, she let go of the kiss and whispered in his ear. "So, front or back~?" Knife, in his sexy raspy voice, whispered back "why not both?" and pinned Mic down on her stomach.</p><p>The two took off each other's clothes, agreeing Mic would take it from the back. Knife put on a condom and gave his thumbs up. Knife's thick rod was about to penetrate her folds. "Ready? Hope you braced yourself." She gave a thumbs-up before moaning quickly at the feeling of his penis within her. It was a beautiful introduction. Knife was grabbing the sides of her ass, and Mic was holding on to her pillows for dear life.</p><p>Her moans started to come out as Knife grew accustomed to her pussy. "Y-yeahhhh, that's the stuff..~," she groaned in pleasure. Knife just smiled and continued to ram his penis into her, giving the occasional slap on the ass for added pleasure. Mic was truly overwhelmed, her breathing getting louder and louder.</p><p>Several minutes passed and Knife had a bit of an interesting idea. He pulled out, much to Mic's dismay. "What are you doing? Please don't tell me you're already done." Mic was afraid he already let a load out or something. Once again Knife said nothing and began to put his penis between her ass. It was like a hotdog being surrounded by a bun. "Oh... oh, hehe... this feels weird... don't stop though," Mic giggled. To prove he wasn't done yet, he sped up his pace and slapped her ass twice more.</p><p>The hotdogging was largely for Knife though, so he stopped in fear that Mic was going to become bored of it really quickly. "Turn around," he said with that sexy voice. Knife slowly jerked himself off to keep him busy while Mic moved to lay on her back. " *Sigh,* missionary. Or as I like to call it, Ol' Reliable."</p><p>Knife positioned himself and he got back to work, this time with a vengeance. Mic's moans were quicker and shorter, with even less breathing room to talk. Her boobs were jiggling together, moving in a circular motion as she used her fists to cover her mouth instinctively. It was the absolute perfect sight to behold for Knife.¬†<em>I am going to ram her so hard she'll be walking funny for a week,</em>¬†he thought to himself.</p><p>Knife put one hand on Mic's left boob, and the other on the bed as Mic's hands were up over her head. "Mmmmmnh, more, give me more!!" Mic almost yelled as her whispering slowly turned into conversation-loud begging. "Such a needy bitch. Whatever floats your boat I guess," he flirted as he tried to put more of his hips into it. His motions were like if he was hula-hooping.</p><p>Ten minutes after Knife's first thrust, he was nearing climax. "O-oh, Mic baby, load's coming.~" Mic was excited to say the very least and jammed her boobs together. <em>Oh well. I usually don't like it when guys pull out. Maybe next time we can live on the edge,</em>¬†she thought. He took a last few thrusts, pulled out so quickly his penis was bobbing up and down, fumbled with his condom and took it off in record time, and jerked off for a few more seconds until a cum shower was gifted to Mic's breasts, the semen coating her nipples and dripping down her perfect mounds. A pool of cum formed in between her breasts. "Wow, you must've wanted this more than me!" Mic said before quickly taking a deep breath for air. The thickness and huge load surprised her. Knife was smitten, giving her a kiss on the lips.</p><p>Both lovers' breathing began to slow down. "So honeybun, want me to clean you up?" Mic shook her head. "Mmm, not just yet. Let's go for a second round~," she said as she wrapped her hand around Knife's dick. His boner came back as the cycle repeated.</p>

</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>"Uggghhhhhh....," Lightbulb groaned, making her intentions clear to Paintbrush that what they were doing was boring as all hell.</p><p>They weren't having it one bit, however. The weather at Hotel OJ lately was nothing but a mess, leaving the two no choice but to stay indoors and rest, for the rain makes the two drowsy. The cusp between March and April finally closed, which meant one thing: it was Paintbrush's time to pay their exorbitant taxes. Paintbrush wasn't the breadwinner by any means‚Äîbeing an artist didn't get themselves much at all other than rent for the hotel and money for utilities. Lightbulb, however, was making bank being a spokesperson for her favorite cookie company.</p><p>But Lightbulb was always blind to this. Her goofy eccentricity clouded her judgment so much Paintbrush questioned how she managed to get such a high-paying job so easily. Must be the charisma.</p><p>"Ughhhhhh, come ooooonnnn, let's go on an adventure. I'm dyyyying here,"Lightbulb complained incessantly as she lied on the bed, her desire to explore and plunder returning once more. She was a girl that lived the fast lane, while Paintbrush preferred to play it safe. Somebody make a sitcom.</p><p>The constant pleas drove them mad. Their breaking point was getting closer and closer until they couldn't contain the anger anymore.</p><p>"Excuse me Lightbulb, will you be a darling for little old me AND SHUT YOUR GODDAMN MOUTH FOR JUST A FEW SECONDS, PLEASE?!? Your childish whining won't pay my taxes any quicker, so go and play with your Switch or something. I'm gonna be busy for a while."</p><p>Lightbulb didn't just wanna have an adventure by herself, however. "But Painty, stepping on Goombas and killing spacebugs and going on epic quests and being an awesome pirate like myself isn't any fun if I don't have you to share it with. You're almost done anyway, so go and play with me, what do you say? Heh, I rhymed, and in such little time."</p><p>Paintbrush scoffed, scowling at the light source bitterly. "Lightbulb, I love you, but I think your circuitry has completely shattered beyond repair. I gotta get this done or else you and I will get out asses sent straight to the slammer!</p><p>Lightbulb decided to make a game out of words and phrases synonymous with jail. "The s l a m m e r ," she said slowly. "The big house. The hoosegow. The bastille. C A L A B O O O S E!!" She rushed into her bedroom, grabbed her kazoo, and started saying the words"calaboose" and "cantankerous" and made a song out of them.</p><p>Clearly, Lightbulb was laughing along at the fun she created for herself, but Paintbrush? Their face was turning red. Suppressing their anger felt like trying to push back the impact of a shockwave.</p><p>They slammed their fist down at the desk. "LIGHTBULB, SHUT! THE! FUCK! UP! THERE ARE A MILLION OTHER THINGS I'D RATHER SPEND MY FLEETING TIME DOING, AND THIS BULLSHIT IS ONLY MAKING THINGS WORSE! ANY TIME I DO ACTUAL WORK FOR US, YOU WASTE TIME AND MAKE A SPECTACLE OF MY HUMILIATION! I'VE HAD IT UP TO HERE WITH THIS BULLSHIT, UGH!!'</p><p>Her laughing came to an immense halt at Paintbrush's vulgar display of anger.</p><p>Lightbulb stammered with fear and regret. "I-I'm s-"</p><p>"I DON'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK, NOT ANOTHER WORD FROM YOU OR YOU LEAVE UNTIL I'M DONE, END OF STORY!" Paintbrush wasn't one to keep their emotions in check, but this time, they meant business, and the message definitely got through.</p><p>Lightbulb's smile turned into one of apprehension and discomfort. "I-I'll go...," she said sheepishly, grabbing her phone, her AirPods, and her wallet as she quickly rushed out of the hotel door.</p><p>Paintbrush's ferocity immediately subsided once the room was completely silent. " *Sigh,* finally, some peace and quiet," they sighed in relief and began work filing their Form W-4 (<b>if you don't know what this is, it's an IRS document that tells an employer how much money to hold back from an employee's paychecks</b>)</p><p>Half an hour passed and they started to ferociously tap their fingers and feet frantically. Sweat started to drip down their face, they fidgeted with the desk supplies, pens clicking, clock ticking like a time bomb...</p><p>"Fuck, Lightbulb, I gotta apologize to her. She was just trying to make my day less boring and I ripped her a new one, as always. There's gotta be a way to make it all better, and I think I know what..."</p><p>Paintbrush began to form a heartfelt text to Lightbulb in an attempt that she'll change her mind.</p><p>üì±<b>¬†</b><em>Lightbulb, I'm sorry for the way I acted towards you. You were being my favorite little bright ball of sunshine as always, and I had to ruin it, like always. I bet you're pretty pissed, so I'll leave you alone, but I just wanted to apologize just in case, because you deserve it. How did I get such a sweet, funny someone as my girlfriend, and dare I say, how is my girlfriend such a hot piece of ass?¬†</em>üòà</p><p>Almost instantly, Lightbulb replied.</p><p>üì±¬†<em>silly, i forgive you!! if anything, i apologize to you for ruining your a-game serious getup. i took my goofy too far, and that's how the tumbleweed rolls, so it's cool, and you're cool! if i'm a hot piece of ass, i don't mind giving you a very special apology myself¬†</em>üòã</p><p>üì±<em>¬†coming back up now. that dick is mine¬†</em>üòò</p><p>Paintbrush tried to continue working, but the anticipation was killing them. The room suddenly got hotter, their hand began to move towards their crotch, but their hand to save their dick from blowing too quick.</p><p>About ten minutes later, Lightbulb came back into her shared room with Paintbrush. The two hugged quickly.</p><p>"Lightbulb, I love you so much. Please forgive me, I've been a fool.</p><p>Lightbulb started to lick her lips. "Don't have to, cause we can do this~." She took off her yellow striped tank top, jeans, and gray bra, leaving her naked except for her panties. She fumbled with Paintbrush's pants as they quickly undid the buttons on their shirt, leaving the two essentially naked.</p><p>"Wait, one thing," they yelled quickly. They grabbed a "Do Not Disturb" sign and placed it on the door, hoping no one would catch them, dick out, and everything. "Alrighty. Show me what you got, cutie.</p><p>Lightbulb rubbed her hands together and began to slowly jerk Paintbrush off. Each finger did a little dance with their shaft as their anger just slipped away. "Mmm," Paintbrush moaned calmly and quietly. She then got out of her previous position and sat on her knees to pleasure Paintbrush.</p><p>"Your dick's like a rocket; I fuel the ship up and then it 'blasts' off," Lightbulb joked. Both lovers chuckled, but Paintbrush found it so hot when she talked about sex so casually. It's like she's an expert. "It could also be a fireman's hose, and I could go for a drink~." She then began to perform oral on them. Her warm breath, her head bobbing up and down, the occasional eye contact with them, the kisses on the shaft‚Äî she was nothing short of an enchantress during sex.</p><p>"S-so much better," they sighed in bliss, grabbing Ligbtbulb's silky blond hair.</p><p>She grabbed their balls in one hand and stroked the other, then switched back to fellatio in this cycle. " A dick is the best lollipop ever because it rarely breaks, always has its flavor, and it's cream-filled," Lightbulb ranted again, getting another laugh from Paintbrush.</p><p>A couple of minutes passed, and their climax was getting ever so closer. The brush decided to jerk off themselves, so Lightbulb opened her mouth wide, tongue out. Her hands rested on her smooth thighs as one of them went up to point at her mouth, signaling Paintbrush to finish there. "I want the cum, N O W," she flirted, hoping her remixed callback from Season 2, Episode 4 would please Paintbrush.</p><p>They let out a giant moan before their sticky seed glazed Lightbulb's face and mouth, some of it getting on her neck. The taste was awful. "Nice job, dude! A lot more than last time, and your aim was better high five!" She wasn't a huge fan of sensual flirting; she loved sex, especially with Paintbrush, but she just preferred to flirt in a way that made sex special in her own right.</p><p>Paintbrush was a bit teed off at how little this might actually mean to her, but they were the one that messed everything up, so they high-fived back to not provoke her anymore.</p><p>"You're such a natural at this Lightbulb. This time, let me pleasure you; I made the mistake of berating you," they suggested, running their fingers through her hair.</p><p>"Ooooh goody, my favorite part!" Lightbulb's fluorescence grew stronger, making her burn brighter. She didn't like to admit it outright, but she was beyond horny. She gave Paintbrush a kiss on the cheek before laying down on her back. Her ass, or lack thereof, wasn't much to gawk at (according to her), but her breasts and curves are where it's at. She wasn't model thin with an hourglass figure, but all the right things were in the right places, and it more than satisfied Paintbrush, so they were happy with her body.</p><p>Their dick lined up at her entrance. "Honey, the paintbrush is about to touch the canvas. You're ready?" Lightbulb giggled, "Paintbrush's Paintbrush, funny." Paintbrush shook their head, "just sit back and relax, ya big goof~."</p><p>She obliged as they began penetration. The first thrusts were slow, but she was in heaven already. "Mmmh, are you sure you're not the natural?" Lightbulb put one hand on her clit, the other on her chest.</p><p>Paintbrush began to increase their speed to something modest. They latched on to her waist for extra leverage, and her body was squirming from the pleasure.</p><p>Lightbulb's boobs jiggling, hips swaying up and down, her rhythmic moans, belly bulging slightly, it was a sight too much for poor Paintbrush that the drool almost dripped out of their mouth.</p><p>"Fuck, you're so tight. It's like your pussy's hugging my dick," they howled as they grabbed Lightbulb's breasts, twiddling her nipples with their soft fingers.</p><p>"Q...ah, quite the charmer~," Lightbulb said quietly, the only words she could muster up at the moment.</p><p>A few minutes passed and Paintbrush was nearing their second climax. They believed their pullout game was weak, but in a brief moment of clarity, they pulled out like usual. She was feeling extra risky today, though.</p><p>"WAIT! F-finish down there, Painty~." They knew this was a bad idea, but being the hot-headed jerk they always were, they didn't have the conscience to go against Lightbulb's wishes, so they entered back into Lightbulb's pussy and thrusted as hard as they could until the semen came. Time stood still as the lovers' moans synchronized with one another. The hot cum entering her sacred area felt so relaxing to her.</p><p>Extremely exhausted, Paintbrush almost collapsed onto Lightbulb still inside her, so they pulled out and went face-first into the covers of their bed.</p><p>"I'm gonna regret not using a condom, aren't I?" Paintbrush's post-nut clarity started to sink in. "Oh, shut your yap and cuddle with me,~" Lightbulb retorted, leaning in for a make-out session with Paintbrush.</p>

<h2 class="heading">Bow X Goo (NSFW)</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Goo was sitting at the house's study on a wintry Friday afternoon, notepad on one side of the desk and the other with a MacBook Air on the other. He was feeling a little uninspired lately, so he decided to engage in several writing exercises to chip away at the behemoth that was his writer's block.</p><p>The man published a collection of his most touching yet relatable sayings and analogies and made a novel out of it,¬†<em>28 Days Flying in the City of Angels,¬†</em>which became a surprise bestseller. He won the hearts of multiple demographics, from Facebook moms, to the suburban boat dads, to the clinically depressed, and even the rich who need more justification to earn even more money. His income skyrocketed, enabling him to finally buy the ceramic pinecone set for his kitchen. Steve Cobs himself partnered with Goo to advertise his book on MePhones everywhere. He had it made, and his best friend Bow was there with him every step of the way.</p><p>That house they were staying at? Goo's newfound success allowed him to rent a luxury home for the weekend from some wealthy businessperson. The $1000 fee for the weekend definitely was lofty, but the owner insured quality lodging plus $200 for food, party supplies, or anything else they thought they might've needed. Goo needed a relaxing break from the stress of his newfound fame, so he wanted to bring somebody to revel in the sweet fruits of his labor with‚Äî and who else but Bow, the girl who's supported him since the beginning?</p><p>At 12:30 PM, Bow walked into the study, interested in how Goo was doing and also kinda bored of the games installed on her phone. He had a history of bending over backwards to make every word of his writing perfect‚ÄîGoo would hyperventilate and overthink when he wrote his book, so she didn't hesitate to take any chances on letting that happen again.<br/><br/></p><p>"Heyyy, what's my bestie up to today?" She said with that valley girl inflection. "Like, how's the writing going?"<br/><br/></p><p>"Oh hey Bow! Yeah, it's going smooth. Smooth like a stucco bathtub and you're about to take the longest bath you've ever had because your day at the office was ruined by your tyrannical boss. But then you sleep in the bathtub, and you think, 'I'm pruning,' and then‚Äî"</p><p>Bow giggled, shushing Goo immediately after. "Ok, you lost me when you opened your mouth."</p><p>Goo chuckled back in embarrassment, face blushing. "Oh, heh, sorry about that. Is there anything you've been up to at the moment?"</p><p>Bow sighed in disgust. "Ugh, I frickin' wish. I woke up like, three hours ago, and tried to make¬†<em>the¬†</em>best glow-up I could. It turns out that I wasted three hours of my precious life trying to post a picture of myself... WITHOUT EVEN THINKING OF USING A SINGLE FILTER. Sis, this ain't it... Low-key I thought I would've thought of Valencia b‚Äî"</p><p>Goo smiled smugly. "I think I'm the wrong person to confide in about this particular subject."</p><p>To put it lightly, Bow's vocabulary wasn't all that extensive. Her math skills were nonexistent. Her critical thinking was needing improvement. Proficiency in science? Pathetic to say the least; she learned the Earth revolves around the sun¬†<b>last week.</b></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Goo chuckled to himself in order to avoid her ridicule. "I don't think I'm the right person to talk to about Instagram filters."</p><p>"Yeah, well you started it, numb-nuts."</p><p>Goo rolled his eyes jokingly. "Well, I apologize for making you wait for so long. I need to get my mojo back though; my publisher says I need all the sap from the Creativity Tree as ink for my next book, whatever that means. I beg of you:¬†<b>please</b>¬†don't do anything stupid while I'm working."</p><p>Bow showed her loyalty to her friend by saluting. "You can count on me, Gooby!"</p><p>Bow decided not to go through the trouble of enduring yet another camera ordeal, so she tried to get back into some more disposable phone game goodness for a bit until she got a snap from her non-exclusive girlfriend, Marshmallow.</p><p>She opened the snap and pressed on the picture to reveal a scantily-clad lady dressed in a white crop top and booty shorts, biting her lip, smiling as she flashed her ass at the camera.</p><p>The caption read "Thinkin' of ya üòò".</p><p>Bow was immediately hooked, fumbling with the zipper on her designer jeans. She was about to begin some precious alone time when she abruptly stopped and, for the first time ever, thought something through.</p><p>
<em>I'd highkey tap that right now if I could, but... let's see if I can try and get all gooey with Goo and see if he can bow before his queen just as well... Men don't impress me as much, but...like... I don't have any other options.</em>
</p><p>After about an hour of scheming, Bow came up with what she thought was a foolproof plan to get in bed with her so-called "Great-Value Fuck Buddy." It really wasn't that elaborate; she'd just turn up the thermostat, go into the pool on the second story to get Goo all riled up and fake body aches to get him to massage her, which would then lead to sex.</p><p>Bow took a long nap to rest up, ensuring nothing would go haywire. When she woke up, it was 6:00 PM‚Äî the pitch-black night outside and frigid temperature of 3 degrees Fahrenheit made it a no-brainer for any person with a pulse to stay indoors and relax in a warm blanket.</p><p>To make the mood sensual as possible, Bow used some of the food money to buy a few candles and massage oil, but Goo's car wouldn't start due to ice coming out the tailpipe, so she had to wait ten minutes for the car to defrost before she could properly start the ignition, much to her chagrin.</p><p>Returning back to the house at 6:30, Bow's next hurdle involved attempting to locate the central thermostat in the house. Her first bet was the owner's master bedroom, so she trekked up to the third story of the house and unfortunately found no thermostat. She looked in any of the bathrooms, the loft, the mudroom, the basement, the garage, guest rooms‚Äî everywhere.</p><p>"...THAT'S RIGHT, THE KITCHEN!"</p><p>She rushed down to the kitchen, groaning as she hoped Goo didn't catch onto her whereabouts.</p><p>And there it was: a high-tech touchpad/voice-controlled thermostat... the thermostat that needed a password to work...</p><p>Bow was losing hope fast.¬†<em>Whoever owns this house needs to frickin' take a chill pill.</em></p><p>7:00 PM. Bow was scavenging the house for any semblance of the password until Goo came downstairs wanting to change the thermostat himself.</p><p>"Hey Bow, I just turned the heat up to 72. How does the owner survive in a 64-degree house during wintertime anyway?"</p><p>To say Bow was annoyed that she ravaged the entire house only for Goo to get access to the thermostat no problem was a complete understatement.</p><p>"H...how did you do that?</p><p>"What, turn the heat up? With my hands, silly!"</p><p>"Ugh, honey, there's a passcode for the thermostat; where did you find it?"</p><p>"Oh, I had it the whole time. The owner texted it to me before we left for this place."</p><p>Bow grumbled to herself: "you better let me top for this..."</p><p>"What did you say, Bow?"</p><p>"Nothing, just a cough! Can I have the password in case I get too cold?"</p><p>Goo thought about it for a bit but shrugged. "Sure, the password is 02492. Annyyywayyy... I'm gonna have some dinner, see you later!"</p><p>Bow just smiled and waved as she tiptoed to the thermostat and typed the password on the touchpad. She looked to her left, looked to her right, and raised the temperature to a toasty 85 degrees.</p><p>She rushed to the guest bedroom she was staying at, put on her favorite bikini, and headed towards the pool. The girl, standing tall at a meager 5 foot 3, had quite the attention-grabbing features for a girl of her height... for better or worse: a 37-inch bust, 25-inch waist size, and 39-inch hips, and a belly button piercing to tie it all together.</p><p>"Time to get into position," she chuckled as she laid down on the lounge chairs.</p><p>Meanwhile, Goo finished the touches on marinating the flank steak that was soon to make a long and winding pilgrimage in his small intestine.</p><p>
<em>Just a touch of salt, a pinch of pepper, and.... done!</em>
<br/>
<em>Geez, I relished any kind of quiet when I tried to write over Bow, but over here the silence is deafening...</em>
</p><p>He put in his wireless earbuds and nodded his head to some soft rock to fill the emptiness.</p><p>
<em>Ahhh... All Time Low... takes me back...</em>
</p><p>Suddenly, he felt the blistering effects of the heat.</p><p>"Wait... is it just me or is it uncomfortably muggy?"</p><p>Goo took off his sweater, which was essentially too soaked to put back on at this point, and sighed as the heat gave him some noticeable fatigue.</p><p>He was about to take a bite of his well-crafted meal, but the sweltering hot air was just too much to bear for him, growing ill-tempered by the discomfort exponentially quickly.</p><p>"Okay, how did it get so hot in here? It was fine minutes ago," he said quietly to himself as he got up from his chair and walked to the thermostat. Needless to say, what he witnessed wasn't all that pleasing.</p><p>"Oh, yeah... WAIT, 85 DEGREES?!? BOW, WHAT DID YOU DO?!?"</p><p>Goo knocked on her bedroom door with a bit of force, demanding some sort of an explanation.</p><p>"Bow? Hello? Come on, this isn't funny!"</p><p>No answer.</p><p>She wasn't in her room, she's not in the kitchen, nowhere to be found in the entertainment center...</p><p>Goo just kind of wandered around the huge house aimlessly. He pulled out his phone and was about to begin texting Bow about the issue when he wandered right past the pool area.</p><p>She chuckled as she opened the pool area door.</p><p>"Heh, feeling a little 'hot-headed' today? Come on honey; beat the heat and cool off with me!" She coaxed, beckoning him with his finger.</p><p>Goo couldn't deny that she looked insanely cute in that bathing suit, but he was deathly afraid that her clumsiness would spell trouble for the both of them.</p><p>"Uhhh... what did you do with the thermostat?"</p><p>"What makes you think¬†<em>I¬†</em>did it?~"</p><p>Goo facepalmed. "It's colder than a witch's tit out there; if the AC went out we'd be freezing our butts off‚Äî that pool would be frozen solid! So why'd you do it?" He was crossing his arms and tapping his foot, impatiently waiting for answers.</p><p>Bow began with the next phase of her plan.</p><p>"Like, I don't know... Maybe the thermostat like short-circuited and OWWWWW!!"</p><p>Goo gasped. "Bow! You okay?"</p><p>"N-no, ahhhh, ohhhh, the pain," she griped, trying her hardest to imitate being hurt. "Ugh, okay. My back is like, really sore. Goo, please help..."</p><p>Goo raised an eyebrow. Something was fishy here.</p><p>
<em>Is she trying to launder money again? Does she want me to pay the rent for the third month in a row? Hmm... I've been wrong before though...</em>
</p><p>He conceded with vigilance.</p><p>"Alright, what can I do to assist you?"</p><p>"Ugh... massage my back; it really hurts!" She laid down on one of the lounge chairs, resting her head on her hands, smiling in anticipation.</p><p>Goo was blushing slightly. He never really got to engage in physical or social contact with others a whole lot. He enjoyed a quiet life free from the hustle and bustle of everyone's overwhelming presence, but this was a nice, reasonable change of pace for the guy.</p><p>"Umm, okay..."</p><p>He was about to reach for her shoulder blades, which he believed were the cause for the soreness and irritation, but Bow quickly stopped him in order to steam things up.</p><p>"Use the massage oil, sweetie," she announced, quickly undoing her bikini strap.</p><p>After Goo got the oil, he stopped in shock at what he was doing for her friend but felt guilty that he started to get a boner from this.</p><p>He motioned over to Bow and sat on his knees as he poured a nickel-size dollop of oil in his hand and began to rub her neck and upper back slowly. He wasn't an expert masseuse, far from it, but he tried his hardest to go off of his intuition regarding how he¬†<em>thought¬†</em>he should go about doing this: back and forth, side to side, up and down. Sometimes he would "chop" her skin with his hands.</p><p>Bow was surprised by Goo's performance. He didn't rock her world or anything like Marshmallow usually did, but she didn't want him to stop‚Äî he wasn't doing half bad.<br/><br/></p><p>She tried the true test to get him completely turned on. "Could you go a little lower?"</p><p>Goo obliged, and his hands were a bit below the shoulder blades.</p><p>Bow hoped he'd get the message sometime soon.</p><p>"Mmm, lower..."</p><p>Goo's hands were at her lower back.</p><p>Bow then took her bikini bottom and pulled them down to her thighs, revealing her perfectly plump ass to the flustered man. He took his hands off of her body, flinching from a severe uptick in confusion and lust.</p><p>"You can go a little lower, doll~"</p><p>"W-wait... Bow? I-I don't think this is about pain relief anymore..."</p><p>"C'mon, don't you wanna make your friend feel better? It's okay, it won't bite~."</p><p>Goo was in utter shock.¬†<em>At least she CLEARLY wants this. I hope I do this right...</em></p><p>He took the massage oil and decided to apply it on her ass. Bow perked up from its cold texture, then exhaled as she felt his warm hands fondling her ample behind. The sensation tickled slightly, making her chuckle quietly.</p><p>Goo was a lot more comfortable with being this up and close with his friend as he eased into the higher steps of physical intimacy. His cock was fully erect, but he didn't care‚Äî her back was turned, and her eyes were closed.</p><p>After a while, Bow grew tired of the foreplay and just wanted to get on with the main event. She took her bikini top and left it on the lounge chair, standing up and whispering her plans seductively as she let her fingers dance on Goo's chest.</p><p>"I wasn't actually in pain. I turned the heat up because I just want you to wreck me. I know you want these tits... this ass... and it's all yours for the night. If you help out a poor girl in need of some good fucking, there's more where that came from..."</p><p>Goo's blood went to his head... and his cock... as her words were calling him to defile that juicy butt of hers.</p><p>Goo just nodded, the words escaping him. He was about to pull his pants off, but Bow beat him to it. She gripped his boner lightly, then removed his boxer briefs to uncover the treasure within. It wasn't the biggest one she'd seen, but far from the smallest; his dick wasn't all that disappointing. Bow was definitely the more dominant personality, so the two nonverbally understood the power structure that would result here: Bow on top, Goo on bottom.</p><p>The two quickly relocated to the master bedroom, where Goo laid down on his back. Bow got on top of him and turned her back positioning her ass.</p><p>Without much hesitation, she pushed downward and began to ride his penis. Goo clearly wanted to moan, but he held them back for fear of embarrassment. He grunted as he gripped Bow's ass tight for leverage, even slapping it every now and then. Bow was pleasantly surprised and let out a well-earned moan.</p><p>She sped up her motions, but not by much‚Äî she was afraid of Goo finishing a bit too quick. She wiggled her butt and shook her hips a bit for a bit of extra flair to their sex.</p><p>"Ooh... so soft... so... much better than internet porn~," Goo uttered out, releasing a powerful moan of pleasure.</p><p>"Wow... I knew I was attractive, but not pornstar attractive!"</p><p>The two laughed, then groaned simultaneously. Bow needed a break from the intense thigh workout she was receiving, so she turned around to face Bow and stopped, his cock inside her.</p><p>"Mmm... you're not that bad at sex, kinda good actually! I was half expecting you'd bust a nut once you'd see me naked, but you're hanging on. Such a good boy~," Bow cooed, tracing a circle around his chest.</p><p>Goo wasn't paying attention; his mind was glued to focusing on her tits.</p><p>"...Are you even listening? Wait... I know what's up."</p><p>Bow took some massage oil and started to lather her breasts up with the fluid, squeezing them, making them squish together. She beckoned him to touch her even more. He was swooning over the sensuality to the point where Bow felt his manhood twitch inside.</p><p>"Look at you, enjoying this so much. We're not even at the best part yet~..."</p><p>Goo just slapped her shoulder, and she began to hump him once more from the front as he held on to her sides. The way Bow bit her lip while smiling, her hands gently on his chest, her sexy voice, soft skin‚Äî it was truly perfect... so perfect he wanted to take the reins.</p><p>He pulled out, grabbing her shoulders to place her neatly on the dirty ground.</p><p>"Heh, my turn~..."</p><p>Goo rubbed her stomach for a few seconds before playing with those sacred breasts of hers for a bit. Bow was in heaven, the foreplay made her hips shake and squirm around as she gripped his cock, rubbing slowly.</p><p>Goo eventually got the message and quickly began to go missionary on Bow. He rammed into her bare body with all the energy he had, making sure every single thrust would make her scream out loud. That didn't happen, but it was no surprise she was enjoying her trance of pleasure, her heart skipping a beat from the pure lust alone.</p><p>It took a while, but Goo found Bow's G-spot, and once his dick hit it, she screamed and cursed his name, turning him on every time she repeated it. It's almost like she howled for Goo, which just made him want to stop even more.</p><p>Goo was pretty close to cumming, so he pulled out and grinded against her stomach until he just couldn't hold his semen in any longer. He released his load all over Bow's breasts, some of it getting on her face and tongue as she shook her body in delight.¬† Goo rushed into the kitchen and grabbed a roll of paper towels so she could clean up. She was a bit tired, so she stayed on the floor while Goo put his pants back on.</p><p>"W-wow Goo... very few men have done a good job at handling me... so like, good job I guess..."</p><p>"Wait, how many times have you had sex?"</p><p>Bow blushed. "I don't think you wanna know the number. Let's just say it's more than enough for one person, but I'm so horny all the time; I can't help it!!! So how about you, sweetie~?"</p><p>Goo began to blush too. "Umm... this was my first... so congrats for taking my virginity, I guess."</p><p>Bow gasped, feeling a bit of disappointment. "Wow... to make you feel any better, you did better than most men I've slept with, and the fact that this was your first time? I'm impressed, Goo."</p><p>Goo laughed. "Thanks... Wait, what does this mean for our friendship?"</p><p>Bow just decided to be direct after the lies she made earlier. "Friends with benefits? If this wasn't too weird..."</p><p>"No no... I can kinda get used to this. As long as you're not cheating on Marshmallow, I'm okay with it."</p><p>Bow smiled. "Coolness! Just don't get too attached. I know I'm hot, but you gotta keep your pants on."</p><p>Goo rolled his eyes. "Oh shut up, I could say the same about you whenever Marshmallow opens her mouth to talk to you! Anyway, I could go for some time in the pool. Wanna join?"</p><p>Bow winked at him as she put her bikini back on. "Sure!</p>

<h2 class="heading">Suitcase X Balloon (NSFW - REQUEST)</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Suitcase walked along a stone-encrusted sidewalk, her belongings in a neatly-organized brown leather backpack. "Whew, I hope Hotel OJ better be worth it this time around."</p><p>The ¬†Australian girl, recently coming runner-up in Inanimate Insanity's second season, couldn't be more ecstatic than she already was to see her best friend Balloon for the first time in several months. Sure, she didn't win as Lightbulb did, who spent the munificent cash prize on a nightclub/aquarium/bakery. She didn't turn out like Knife, who used the notoriety he accrued on the show to swiftly form that punk band he spent so much of his downtime talking about. Baseball? Suitcase couldn't care less at this point.</p><p>"The suffering? The anxiety? The nightmare spells and gaslighting I endured from Baseball and Nickel's ceaseless manipulation? It doesn't matter as long as I know Balloon's going to be there by my side."</p><p>She wishes her psychosis on nobody, but she has it to thank for her newfound courage. What a world.</p><p>Suitcase reached the entrance of Hotel OJ and quickly opened the door. Being a guest can't be nearly as bad as being a contestant coerced into hours of manual labor, right?</p><p>It appeared as if her doubts withered away as the elevator music and ambiance of the swanky hotel soothed the madhouse that was her mind. And the best part? OJ was nowhere to be found at the front desk!</p><p>"Welcome to Hotel OJ; what can I help you with today?" replied Paper. "Good afternoon! I came to visit Balloon." He quickly realized who he was tending to. "Oh, you're Suitcase! I watched the finale on my phone. Let me just say that I personally wanted you to win. You've dealt with so much, and watching you stand up to the others genuinely helps me believe I can do the same." Suitcase never met him before, but going solely by first impressions, he was an amiable person.</p><p>"Haha, thanks! I tried my hardest, but to be honest, I don't mind Lightbulb winning the grand prize. She's got a heart of gold, and I hope she fulfills her dreams of living her best life with Paintbrush and Baxter."</p><p>Paper smiled. "I appreciate your humility, seriously. With this cast of characters lounging around here, respect can be...scarce. Balloon's lucky to have a good friend like you. I'll call him and tell you he's got a visitor, but just in case he doesn't pick up, he's in room 204."</p><p>Suitcase smiled and almost blushed at his awfully sweet comment. "Great, thank you so much!" She tipped him a $10 bill and headed up to the third floor.</p><p>The girl waited for an elevator to come by. When one arrived, Cheesy already occupied the stuffy space.</p><p>"Hey Suitcase, you're back! I hope you're not carrying any 'baggage' from last season. Ha, get it? 'Baggage?'" He slapped his knee furiously. How is this bonehead's knee not entirely red and bruised? Suitcase questioned.</p><p>She gave a sympathy laugh and said nothing afterward as the elevator door opened. Let's see, room 207, 206, 205... Ah, there we go, 204. Her mind was racing in anticipation as the shy girl waited outside his door. Months of solitude, a taxing blow to her self-esteem. When Balloon graced her field of vision, any hardship she ever faced in life and on Inanimate Insanity just... didn't matter anymore. With him, Suitcase could live to her full potential.</p><p>She knocked on the door. Balloon stood at the entrance, a bright, glorious smile on his face. "SUITCASE! It's been ages; please come inside!" The two embraced for a warm hug, which Suitcase enjoyed more than she wanted to admit.</p><p>"Aww, thank you! I almost forgot what a hug felt like there; I really needed that. You have no idea how much I missed you!"</p><p>Suitcase was touch starved as a child. Her mother, often bedridden from a list length of ailments, lacked the energy to provide any kind of physical intimacy. Her father was autistic; he had a strict no-touch policy, and any violators would be subject to a bit of yelling, so for her, what seemed like a simple hug could be compared to getting high.</p><p>"Well, don't mention it," Balloon replied gingerly. "Sit on the bed, and please, tell me how you've been doing these past few months. I know that there's a lot of stuff that happens off-camera."</p><p>Suitcase took a deep breath. She was a bit uncomfortable with going back to this treacherous time, but she confided in Balloon before, and he was an excellent listener, so she didn't mind.</p><p>"Uhhh, let's see... As you probably already know, the show became really tense. It was almost like watching Parliament argue, you know, with the factions and cliques that started to solidify when you left after the bucket challenge.</p><p>Balloon nodded. "How so?" "Well, behind the scenes, Nickel would constantly tell me I was a dead man, that I was a traitor, that I'd regret ever running my mouth towards him. He told me I was a puny sack of... you know what, that I would rot into everlasting hellfire, stuff like that. Excuse me for the language, but yeah... he turned into a giant asshole."</p><p>Frustrated by such rude remarks, Balloon couldn't contain his anger. "Man, that's horrible! I hope to never talk to him again! All he cares about is his stupid alliance and his one-sided parasitic goals of his... he latches on to us and for what!? I know that I was a mess in Season 1, but I've shown all I can show that I've changed, and I guess he'll never get the message because I wanted to THINK FOR MYSELF! But you...you saw past the slander... you stood up for me when everybody else wanted me out of their lives forever. You're so smart and funny, and strong... I'm forever grateful for what you did, Suitcase; you're a true friend. I don't know what kind of crazy circumstances had to happen for you to suffer so much on Inanimate Insanity, because you never deserved it.</p><p>As for Suitcase... she was in awe. She almost cried at the way Balloon was just pouring his big, caring heart out. "N-nobody has ever said stuff like that to me before. All my life I pushed everybody away, so I didn't have too many friends, and the people who did interact with m-me treated me like a doormat," she uttered, voice quivering. "I don't think I can do this in one night, but is there a way I can repay you for your kindness?"</p><p>Balloon put his thumb and index finger in his hands. "Hmm... I'm not sure. You've done too much already being my friend and everything; it's ok, I promise," he insisted, gently putting his hand on the girl.</p><p>It was at that moment that Suitcase blushed a deep crimson. For months, she daydreamed about innocent love‚Äîwalks on the beach, picnic dates, at-home takeout dinner dates where they watch a nostalgic cheesy movie... but now? There was a certain tingly itch controlling her thoughts. Risqu√© thoughts. Ideas so outlandish, so impure, so... liberating...</p><p>"U-um, uh, Balloon? There's s-something I think y-you could d-do to make b-both of us f-feel b-better..."</p><p>Suitcase's stomach churned; her body was heating up and shaking as the woman's mind raced.</p><p>How would Balloon react, how could he look me in the eyes after what I'm about to offer, how would...how would... what will... when...</p><p>Balloon was in the kitchen, trying to get each other something to eat. When he went back to the couch where Suitcase was sitting, she still looked dissatisfied somehow.</p><p>"Oh come on, you don't have to return any favors, it's okay!</p><p>...</p><p>"Wait, what did you have in mind?</p><p>Suitcase gulped and just decided to go for it.</p><p>"W-well, w-w-would you w-want in‚Äî, um, d-do you th‚Äî, no... H-heh, sorry..."</p><p>...</p><p>"I-I w-want y-you to t-take away my v-v-virginity..."</p><p>¬†</p><p>Balloon, drinking some cola, immediately spit out the fizzy drink.</p><p>"Come again?"</p><p>Suitcase took a deep breath once more.</p><p>"I want you to have me," she said, this time absolutely certain about this request.</p><p>To put it lightly, Balloon couldn't wrap his head around what she wanted. "Uhh... ok... this is news to me..."</p><p>Suitcase's heart almost stopped. "Uh oh, are you angry? I'm so sorry, I don't know what came over me, I swear! I apologize if this is kinda sudden, but... ever since you were eliminated, I realized how much I truly enjoyed being around you, Balloon. I'm gonna I think we should be more than friends in some way."</p><p>Balloon was at a loss for words. "W-wait, so you want to be my girlfriend?"</p><p>"I think so, but it's all too much to be entirely certain right now. What I want right now is for you to... how do I put this... make our next chapter together official‚Äîthat is, if you're willing to."</p><p>Balloon was staring down at the ground. A few seconds afterward, he lifted his head back up again and smiled. "I'd want nothing more, sweetheart~."</p><p>He grabbed Suitcase by the waist and started to kiss her passionately. Suitcase was taken a bit by surprise at the romantic gesture, but she definitely welcomed it, putting her arms on Balloon's shoulders. With every lip smack came a moan. "Mm, this feels so right~," she uttered out in between kisses.</p><p>Balloon then began to kiss her neck. Suitcase yelped softly but immediately fell in love with the feeling as if her body felt numb but also incredibly sensitive at the same time. He was lightly stroking her hair in one hand and gently grabbing the blissful girl by the shoulder. He whispered in her ear sensually.</p><p>I missed you so much...~</p><p><br/>Suitcase could feel the butterflies pretty much everywhere after the foreplay. She felt her vagina pulsate and throb, her nipples enlarged, little did he know. She noticed that Balloon's penis was completely erect and tried her luck at seduction for the first time in ages, chuckling at how stupid this would sound coming out of her mouth.</p><p>"Let's see if I can help process this 'package' of yours~."</p><p>Suitcase coaxed Balloon to sit on the bed, and the horny boy obliged, unable to contain his wide smile. She flicked his penis several times, then fumbled with the zipper on his jeans, of which Balloon assisted. Once the jeans were off, Balloon took off his shirt as she pulled down his underwear.</p><p>Suitcase almost drooled at the sight of Balloon's nakedness. His slightly pudgy dadbod was insanely attractive to the girl (she absolutely hated toned, jacked bodies), but her eyes were on the prize that was his six-inch cock.</p><p>"Oh, wow~..."</p><p>She had no idea what she was about to do‚Äîthe girl watched porn about once a month, ¬†but she would orgasm so quickly that the foreplay was the only act she could replicate. Despite that, she pressed on for her friend and possibly a newfound lover.</p><p>Suitcase began to slowly jerk Balloon off. She may not have realized it, but he was mesmerized by how much of a tease she actually was. Her leisurely wrist motions‚Äî up, down, up, down‚Äî they turned him on like mad watching an introverted, innocent girl try her luck at a handjob.</p><p>"Mm, you can go a bit faster~."</p><p>She obliged and began to stroke double time. Balloon was starting to moan, waves of pleasure crashing over his body like a tsunami. Occasionally, Suitcase would take a break from ogling at his cock and look at him directly, and they would chuckle. It seemed surreal that this was actually happening with a best friend of all people, but they found it impossible to picture performing a sacred act with anyone else. Balloon was fantasizing about what Suitcase's bare body would look like. He didn't care about breast size, ass size, shaven or unshaven, whatever‚Äî he just wanted to see her undressed. Suitcase was daydreaming about how that dick would feel inside of her body; it made her wet just thinking about it.</p><p>Suitcase let go of Balloon's cock and lowered her head, initiating a blowjob for her horny buddy.</p><p><br/>"O-ohh... S-suitcase, how are you so g-good at this?"</p><p>She didn't answer‚Äîall she wanted to focus on was that precious penis. Being a virgin, she believed it would taste salty and gross, but in actuality, his member was free of any taste or odor‚Äîonly texture prevailed, and the smoothness of it gave Suitcase a level of euphoria she never experienced before.</p><p>Knowing how much Suitcase loved intimate touch, he petted the top of her head. He wanted to really show her she was doing a great job.</p><p>"Mm, such a good girl, aren't you?~"</p><p>The two laughed at a (kinda corny) porn one-liner, but it didn't matter‚Äîthe intention was clear as day anyway.</p><p>Minutes passed, and Balloon was nearing climax. He was unsure of where to finish, so he let Suitcase take the reins on this one. He was so far up in heaven that he had to resort to caveman speak to communicate.</p><p>"F-faster, f-faster!"</p><p>Suitcase bobbed her head up and down as fast as she could until she had a pretty sexy idea. She took Balloon's cock out of her mouth and opened it real wide to signal him she wanted to taste his hot cum.</p><p>"G-give it to me... l-let it all out f-for me, please...~"</p><p>He repositioned himself, sitting on his knees to match Suitcase's height, and began to finish himself off. He tried to aim for her mouth as best as he could, but Balloon was unable to control his body at all once his orgasm began, so spurts of the thick gooey liquid ended up all over her forehead, cheeks, and chin instead.</p><p>Is this a lot? I'm not sure, but Balloon seemed like he was pretty backed up</p><p>Balloon's body went limp, both entirely satisfied with Suitcase's performance, but also incredibly disappointed in himself for missing the target.</p><p>"I'm sorry Suity, I couldn't control myself, heh heh... Gosh, you're so good at this..."</p><p>Suitcase chuckled. "Don't worry about it, it's our first time!" She chuckled, kissing the tip of Balloon's member. B-besides, Round 2's g-gonna be better." She was a wreck, unable to hold still as the anticipation was almost unbearable.</p><p>"W-what's in store for Round 2?" Balloon was egging her on.</p><p>"Silly, you r-return the favor~."</p><p>Suitcase got up from the bed and motioned to the bathroom, thinking she'd take off her clothes and surprise Balloon that way, but she thought up of an idea that she thought would completely leave him horny for her.</p><p>"O-oh, I just remembered... I, uh, umm... I 'injured' myself typing on my c-computer the other day... would you m-mind h-helping me out h-here?"</p><p>Balloon smiled smugly. "If you wanted me to strip you down, you could've just asked," he chuckled, kissing her on the cheek.</p><p>Balloon got up from the bed, first undoing the belt on her brown khaki pants, pulling them down to reveal a sopping wet pair of undergarments.</p><p>"W-wow, eager... That's good!"</p><p>He then assisted with pulling her brown sweater up, followed by a white undershirt underneath. What was left was her brown pair of panties and bra. Balloon used his teeth to try and undo the straps, and the attempt was not just sexy, but successful.</p><p>Suitcase pulled her panties down herself.</p><p>"S-suity... you look... immaculate." He paused to find the perfect word to describe how cute yet undeniably hot she was, her bare body and cum-soaked face complimenting the white curtains behind her.</p><p>Suitcase just chuckled at Balloon's highly flattering remarks. She couldn't lie: he knew just the right words to use to make her feel like the most special individual on this earth.</p><p>She motioned back over to the bed, laying down on her back. Balloon followed suit immediately after and began teasing. He put a finger slightly above her pussy and traced upward to the top of her chest, and began to massage her 34C breasts, sort of kneading them like bread.</p><p>"Mmmmmm...~"</p><p>Balloon would occasionally lick her nipples in a circle, which elicited a few moans out of the horny girl. Suitcase arched her back and stretched her hands upward to give him more room to do so.</p><p>He kissed her neck for another minute, which was the precursor to licking and nibbling. Eventually, his tongue began to wander south, down to her boobs, her stomach, and eventually her vagina, where he flicked her clit up and down. Suitcase had to grab a pillow to mute the louder moans she was making as a result.</p><p>As Balloon was going to town on Suitcase, she gripped the back of his scalp, and he gripped her sides. She had drool running down her lip, hoping he'd stay down there forever. Balloon would rub her stomach while licking to give his hands something to do while satisfying her desire for touch.</p><p>"Mmnh... mmm... uuuungh... I-I'm gon-... gonna..."</p><p>Balloon couldn't hear, and without much warning, Suitcase had her orgasm, biting into her pillow as she squirted onto his tongue. He didn't stop‚Äîthe taste of salty mango was like an aphrodisiac, thereby cleaning the ooze up.</p><p>"Sigh... Balloon... e-enough teasing... I'm r-ready... l-let's do this..."</p><p>Balloon smiled. "You sure?" She nodded quickly.</p><p>"P-put it in me already, please!"</p><p>The two chuckled. Secretly, this turned Balloon on, and he wanted to oblige, but he wanted to be extra careful for their first time.</p><p>"Hold on, I gotta get some protection real quick. Gimme a sec."</p><p>He got up from the bed and rustled around his nightstand drawer to find some condoms. He was getting scared to find none available until he saw just one more in the drawer, of which Balloon sighed in relief.</p><p>He got back onto the bed and put his condom on slowly, hoping he wouldn't break it. Suitcase nudged upward on the bed, squirming in excitement.</p><p>"Alright, this may hurt a bit, so be cognizant of that before I begin. Also, what position do you wanna do?"</p><p>Suitcase didn't listen; she just nodded her head and decided to do reverse cowgirl. She motioned Balloon to lie down as she turned around, showcasing her moderately-sized ass to him. He licked his lips devilishly.</p><p>"I handled a reality show, I t-think I c-can handle a little p-pain." The two laughed in unison as Suitcase was mere inches from penetration.</p><p>"H-here goes..."</p><p>Once Suitcase aligned her pussy properly, she squatted down, only to form to an annoying stinging sensation.</p><p>"Owwwww!"</p><p><br/>"Suitcase, are you okay? Oh gosh, what did I do??"</p><p>"No no, I should've listened to the warning... I'm gonna l-lie down for a bit..."</p><p>Lying on her back, she winced as drops of blood soaked the white bedsheets. Balloon, a bit annoyed, doused some paper towels in water to clean the sheets. Luckily, it came out, but he was ultimately concerned for his friend. He tried kissing Suitcase's neck gently to ease the pain.</p><p>Several minutes passed, and the pain subsided.</p><p>"Okay Balloon, I t-think the p-pain's gone..."</p><p>"Cool! Aren't you gonna get up?"</p><p>"N-no no, I'm good, I'm g-good..."</p><p>Balloon secretly wanted her to say that‚Äî his favorite position was missionary. He was more boring than he'd like to admit.</p><p>"Alrighty, let's try this again," he said as he adjusted his penis, sliding into her slowly. The pain was still kinda there for Suitcase, but it was far more manageable this time around.</p><p>Balloon began to thrust in and out, slowly but surely for his friend. She was wincing slightly. Oh no, I think she's really in pain... I think I'm gonna call it here...</p><p>As he continued to softly ram into her, the wincing and painful groans gradually transitioned into pleasurable moans. Suitcase was truly in heaven.</p><p>"Ahhhhh, f-f-fuck, Balloon..." She rarely cursed, but all this pleasure let go of any semblance of inhibition she had left.</p><p>This was enough of a reason for him to thrust at a more comfortable pace. Everything in this moment of time for the two‚Äî the sounds of their heavy breathing, Balloon clenching his teeth, Suitcase suppressing her moans with her fists‚Äî the two achieved immediate bliss.</p><p>Balloon grabbed her left breast for leverage, while Suitcase rested her right hand on her stomach.</p><p>"G-God dammit, Suitcase... fuck... t-tell me you're mine... p-please tell me you'll never l-leave me," he begged, voice quivering. Sex got romantic real fast.</p><p>Suitcase was delighted to hear him say that.</p><p>"Mmm... I'll a-always be by your s-side, B-Balloon... T...t-til the e-end of time, I a-am all y-yours..."</p><p><br/>"Ahhhnnh, darling... now t-tell me you l-love me... I l-love you s-so much, Suit... S-Suitcase..."</p><p>Her eyes were getting watery; she was an emotional wreck as Balloon was thrusting into her as fast as he could. Her boobs were jiggling and her body was quivering.</p><p>"Ahhhh... mmm... I... I... ughghhhh... I-l-l-love you, B-Balloon! I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU SO VERY MUCH!!"</p><p>Balloon and Suitcase, still in the middle of sex, shared a long kiss on the lips as the two were grateful. Their love for each other was reciprocated. They could finally bond as one entity together. At this moment, it was them against the world.</p><p>A few minutes later, the explosion of love was approaching fast.</p><p>"S-Suity... I'm g-gonna cum... b-before I do, answer m-me this: w-will y-you... b-be my g-girlfriend?"</p><p>He facepalmed as he continued to thrust. Why now? I was hoping I'd tell her in a more appropriate location...</p><p>Suitcase didn't seem to find any faults with this at all. She smiled as wide as she could, knowing that she had a partner for the first time ever.</p><p>"Oh... o-oh my g-god, YES! Y-yes, h-honey, d-do it..."</p><p>"Uunnngh... m-move your hand..."</p><p>With what seemed like superhuman strength, Balloon ripped his condom off and finished himself off once more, moving upward to her lower stomach. Suitcase obeyed and closed her eyes, smiling for the big finale. With a few powerful strokes, Balloon's cock essentially exploded with cum, drenching her boobs and tummy in the warm, sticky liquid.</p><p>Their moans still synchronized, Suitcase put a finger on her belly and tasted the cum a few times. She hated its murky taste, but she couldn't get enough of it somehow.</p><p>Balloon got up from the bed and handed her a rag to clean herself up. They dressed, took a shower, and decided to watch YouTube for a few hours afterward, relishing in the new chapter of their relationship together as boyfriend and girlfriend.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Suitcase didn't tell him this yet, but she wanted to move into Hotel OJ for her mental health. For now, she wanted to see where the relationship went, so she decided to tell him later on down the line. She kissed Balloon goodbye and left for home, a ginormous smile on her face.</p><p>On her way out, she saw Paper at the front desk again.</p><p>"Hey Suitcase! Did you enjoy your stay at Hotel OJ?"</p><p>Suitcase had a smug look on her face.</p><p>"Yep, I sure did..."</p>

<h2 class="heading">Silver Spoon X Candle Part 2 (NSFW)</h2>
<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I just really like this ship a lot lol</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Two weeks have passed since Silver Spoon and Candle first made love in the Calm Down Cabana, and the newly formed relationship has been sailing quite smoothly. The two have been going on long walks on the beach, hands intertwined. The couple has been feeding each other chocolates and strawberries courtesy of the pic-nix tables. Spoon even used his opulence to hire an entire chamber orchestra as music for their nighttime dates, which definitely got the entire island invested. Needless to say, both Candle and Silver Spoon were enjoying each other's company immensely. The woman did have some gripes about how materialistic Spoon was being, however‚Äî Candle was very minimalistic and preferred to show her devotion for him in symbolic, more metaphysical ways.</p><p>Candle woke up to the peaceful sound of the waves crashing against the sand. Her phone read "6:43, August 5th," smirking as she read the date. It was her birthday today, and with how much of Silver Spoon's wealth was being used on their date nights, she had a hunch that something big would be planned on her big day. She hoped to keep a low profile as to not disturb the atmosphere of the blue auras surrounding the outside world.</p><p>To begin her day, Candle scavenged the beach to ensure the start of her daily meditation regimen at 7:00 sharp to satisfy her chakras. She found her favorite tree, set her favorite carpet on the ground, and sat in the lotus position to take in the serenity of the cool, sunny morning.</p><p>
<em>Breathe in... out... in... out... I am one with the dynamic world... the world is one with me... Let our thoughts collide... we are the same entity...</em>
</p><p>7:30 AM. There was a nice lack of wind outside, so Candle decided to light some incense to relax even further. The faint scents of lavender and sweetgrass blending in with the resin and the air-dried clay of the incense holder made the woman completely at ease. She took a deep breath and sighed in relief.</p><p>
<em>I am so... in tune with my surroundings. Nothing can sway me away from the rhythms of the air...</em>
</p><p>By 8:00 AM, if Candle was any more relaxed, she'd be dead and probably would have reached enlightenment by now. A faint smile formed upon her face as she sensed a tall being standing in front of her.</p><p>"My my if it isn't my leading lady."</p><p>Candle opened her eyes and couldn't help but chuckle a bit.</p><p>"Well hello, dumpling." She got up from her meditation and went on her tippy toes to kiss Silver Spoon on his left cheek. "What brings you here?"</p><p>"I'm surprised that such an introspective lady such as yourself hasn't caught on yet. Candle, my sweet, it is with the dearest heart that I wish upon you a glorious day of goodwill and celebration. Happy birthday, darling." He kneeled down and kissed her right hand.</p><p>She giggled at such a dramatic gesture. "Oh Spoon, you big fancy pants, a hug would've been enough! Thank you!"</p><p>He was saddened by her reaction, but ultimately let it go for her happiness. "Oh, alright," he sighed, his arms opening wide. Candle grabbed him by the waist and reveled in their warm embrace, holding tightly onto each other's grasp.</p><p>"Thank you again, Spoon. This truly means a lot to me." She gave the man one final hug before OJ called each other to talk strategy near the outskirts of the island.</p><p>Time kinda slipped past by the two. What evolved into a quick meeting turned into a series of team-building games and self-betterment exercises that spanned a few hours. After the torment, the two took a nap and woke up around twilight.</p><p>"So dear, we must embark on a cornucopia of festivities for such a special lass like yourself. What's say you‚Äî we hire contractors to erect a weatherproof gazebo for your birthday luncheon, I'll recruit the best pyrotechnician within a 30-mile radius to organize a fireworks display with a special message dedicated to you, or if I ensure everything goes swimmingly, I could try and have an ice sculpture delivered by helicopter to our very location!"</p><p>Candle rolled her eyes playfully.</p><p>"I appreciate what you have been doing for me, but I think it's about time I decided how we spend our quality time together.</p><p>"What do you suggest?"</p><p>"Well, I'm not the biggest fan of these ornate, grandiose gestures. My perfect idea for a date... consists of stuff that's a bit... more low profile.</p><p>Spoon was concerned.</p><p>"Wait, how come you refused to interject?"</p><p>"You cute dummy, these were all surprise date ideas. You went on with your all-out plans without really consulting me."</p><p>"I see...," Spoon uttered, his head lowering in shame.</p><p>Candle recognized his discontent.</p><p>"<b><em>But,¬†</em></b>seeing that you spent all this time and money without batting an eye shows how far you would go to make me happy . I can see your devotion to me in your soul and your aura casts a pink hue; it truly fills my heart up with a radiant light." She blushed, pouring her feelings out to the thin man in front of her.</p><p>As if this wasn't some kind of soap opera already, Silver Spoon's loving smile came back once more as he held Candle's hands in his.</p><p>"I would do anything to keep you, to maintain your respect, your love. You're the best thing that ever happened to me, darling.~"</p><p>Candle couldn't help but succumb to the slush.</p><p>"Awwww~..." The two hugged tightly, Candle whispering "I love you" in the process.</p><p>"So... about a date idea that's a bit more casual, I was thinking we'd just eat pizza or something... with vegan cheese for me of course!"</p><p>"Such a... pedestrian choice... the grease, the cheese that burns your tongue, oh how messy!"</p><p>Candle scoffed lightly. "Oh get over it, Nancy LeFancy; a little bit of dirt is good for the soul."</p><p>"But... oh, ok. It's your birthday, after all."</p><p>Both lovers motioned over to the pic-nix tables. Silver Spoon generated one pepperoni pizza for himself, the other a vegan veggie pizza for Candle, then they sat down and ate at the shoreline. She immediately sat down and dug into the tasty dinner, but Spoon was offended by the atrocity of such an unclean finger food.</p><p>
<em>No silverware and not a single napkin in sight... oh, dear me...</em>
</p><p>He pressed on and reluctantly gripped his fingers onto the crust. After he took a bite, he witnessed a titillating sight across from him: the stringy cheese on Candle's pizza started to fall off, so she raised the slice above her head and used her tongue to try and save the cheese from being ruined into the sand before finally taking a large bite.</p><p>Silver Spoon couldn't concentrate. He wasn't hungry for food anymore... he was hungry for his girlfriend.</p><p>Around twenty minutes later, Candle finished her pizza. She was about to lay down in the sand but noticed that Spoon had yet to finish even one slice.</p><p>"Seriously, Spoon? I don't want you to go hungry; please eat!"</p><p>"Oh... uh... a-alright..." Spoon was trying his very hardest to conceal a fast-growing boner forming in his pants, but he had nothing to really grab onto to put into his lap, so he took another bite out of his slice of pizza and turned to the left slowly as to not garner attention.</p><p>Candle saw what he was doing and thought little of it; she was just relieved to see her boyfriend get some food in him. Such a tall man consuming such minuscule food portions concerned the woman. However, she noticed that Spoon's aura started to shift towards a blood red hue, the color of passion and anger. Needless to say, the woman was intrigued.</p><p>Silver Spoon actually ate another slice of pizza in an attempt to distract himself from thinking about his girlfriend sexually while on a romantic date. The plan was working as intended until Candle motioned over next to him to investigate.</p><p>"Sweetie, you're eating your pizza way too fast. Is something okay?"</p><p>"Yes, yes, quite fine.," he said as his eyes darted back and forth.</p><p>Candle raised an eyebrow. When Silver Spoon wasn't looking, she stared at his face to study his body language, then looked downwards. She smiled, the culprit to his restlessness. Witnessing her boyfriend so turned on, the feeling was quickly reciprocated as Candle bit her lip.</p><p>"Spoon, I think I know what else I wanna do with you for my birthday."</p><p>She held his hand tightly and hastily walked towards the Calm Down Cabana</p><p>"W-what are we doing here? This was where we‚Äî"</p><p>Candle interrupted him from the excitement.</p><p>"Wait right here."</p><p>She rushed as fast as she could and grabbed an unlabeled box of sex toys she hid under her bed, and went to the pic-nix tables to generate some ice cream and chocolate syrup. Scurrying back, she was exhausted and panting heavily, but took a minute to catch her breath.</p><p>"It's that time again~..."</p><p>"Well, you ARE the birthday girl~..."</p><p>The two started to passionately make out as they entered the Calm Down Cabana slowly. Each individual smack, every little exchange of saliva, both Spoon and Candle were enraptured by each other's warm bodies.</p><p>Candle let go of the embrace and reached for the hem of her shirt, lifting it up and throwing it across the floor. She beckoned her boyfriend to come over and assist her with the rest, which he was delighted to oblige by. Her warm breath running down Silver Spoon's face as he unzipped her jean shorts left him beyond excited. With shaky hands, he pulled her panties down as she undid her bra. Silver Spoon's heart felt like beating out of his chest as his eyes darted across Candle's sexy figure.</p><p>Candle trotted over to Spoon and fumbled with his belt, ravenous for the aching shaft cloaked under hot fabric. His dick sprung out of his pants with glee.¬† As he was undoing the buttons on his shirt, Candle motioned over to the ottoman and moved it right in front of the couch before laying down and getting comfortable.</p><p>Silver Spoon sat on his knees and grabbed his cock, lining it up with Candle's entrance.</p><p>"W-wait, don't put it in just yet. Let's get a little weird first~." Candle pointed at the box of adult toys at the corner of the cabana.</p><p>He took the box and moved it next to the ottoman, then reached without looking to pull out a dark blue vibrator.</p><p>"Check what's underneath~."</p><p>Spoon followed his girlfriend's sultry order and reached for some handcuffs and the syrup she generated minutes ago. He smiled as he tied her up to some nearby posts, erection returning with a vengeance.</p><p>Candle giggled. "Hope you're good at cleaning up~."</p><p>She turned on the vibrator at a low speed and inserted it in slowly while Silver Spoon opened the syrup cap, drizzling two spiral shapes on her breasts. Candle jerked up slowly at the cold, sticky sensation, but instantly hummed in delight when his hot tongue reached contact with her nipple.</p><p>Silver Spoon didn't have much to say about what he was doing; it was unfamiliar, horrifically dirty, and a bit too perverted for his tastes, but all of his apprehensions as he heard Candle's alluring grumbles and groans.</p><p>Spoon's tongue circled around her lusciously firm mounds, making sure to reach every little nook and cranny. When one breast received little attention, he'd switch sides and repeat the process. Candle moaned with a bit of intensity as he tended to her nipples as well; licking, nibbling, flicking, the whole nine yards.</p><p>"Mmm, make sure to get it allllll, ahnh~..."</p><p>Spoon started to grope Candle's breasts gently, kissing her chest and moving upwards to her neck. "S-so warm, so s-soft," he uttered gently, simply enchanted by her grace.</p><p>Silver Spoon shot up from his position and reached for the syrup bottle once more, this time oozing the liquid in a straight line from the top of her chest down to just above her vagina. He took the now melted ice cream and let it drip down into her belly button as Candle increased the speed of the vibrator.</p><p>He swiftly got to work, making large, sloppy circles around her stomach. The anticipation was agonizing for the two as Spoon went further south.</p><p>Candle turned off the vibrator and put it away as Spoon looked deep into her beautiful eyes, lust overpowering his thoughts. She nodded her head and patted his short blond hair as he slowly dipped his tongue inside. Spoon was instantly hooked, reveling in an organ so taboo, but in a sensation so right. Candle exhaled heavily, humming along in pleasure with the two in a euphoric state.</p><p>"F-faster, sweetie, f-faster," she insisted, her hands running through his soft hair.</p><p>With Candle's soft, inviting thighs tightly in the grasp of Silver Spoon's hands, he flicked his tongue twice as fast around her cl!t, deadlocked in the present moment.</p><p>"S-so wet, mmmauhugh...~"¬†</p><p>Candle's moans grew louder and longer, bucking her hips forward as she approached orgasm. She gripped the couch feverishly, ripping the leather in the process. She couldn't deal with any more teasing: she needed dick and she needed that dick right then and there.</p><p>She spread her lips open with her fingers.</p><p>"Go nuts~..."</p><p>"Darling, you have no idea."</p><p>Both lovers chuckled while Spoon lined up the tip of his member with her entrance. A few seconds later, he slipped it in slowly and felt an immediate sensation of pleasure flow through him.</p><p>"Ungh, simply divine~"</p><p>He went slowly at first, but his excitement got the best of him and quickly sped up his pace.</p><p>Candle was yelping and moaning left and right, her body shaking at the intense activity.</p><p>Silver Spoon rammed into her as fast as he could, no inhibitions or restraints left in himself. Three minutes later, he felt that familiar knot in his stomach once again, quickly pulling out and leaning forward. Candle instinctively opened her mouth as her boyfriend's thick, massive load splashed onto her torso and face. She rubbed her belly and wiped off the cum, giving her boyfriend a little show by licking her hand clean.</p><p>During recovery, Spoon released the handcuffs from the posts and kissed Candle on the cheek. She got up and kissed him right back, her hands stroking his shaft slowly and cupping his balls.</p><p>"H-happy b-birthday, my sweet angel," Spoon declared, entirely smitten by his girlfriend's smooth touch.</p><p>"Thank you dumpling."</p><p>The two stared at Silver Spoon's penis as the handjob continued.</p><p>"This is only the beginning, you know. Your birthday's next week. Prepare yourself, Spoon. I'm not going easy on you.~"</p>

<h2 class="heading">Salt X Pepper (NSFW)</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>I apologize that I haven't really uploaded any LGBTQ+ stories here, straight stories are the easiest to write and I wanted to do these more justice. K time for sex<br/><br/></p><p>Mid-June, the perfect time at Hotel OJ‚Äî perfect for the establishment's eponymous owner because he can start charging extra for the influx of summer tourists, perfect for Paper because none of said tourists have arrived yet, and perfect for the regulars because this is the small nick of time where the pool doesn't resemble a musty can of crowded tuna. It was optimal relaxation time before they surrender these perks to crazed fans and snobby travel enthusiasts with cameras on par with NASA laser technology.</p><p>Salt, a prominent regular and prima-donna, found the seasonal change enticing for a variety of reasons: she could finally use the hot tub, gawk at OJ, sunbathe out on the pool deck, swoon over OJ, watch shooting stars fly during a bonfire, and even catch the rare glimpse of OJ with his shirt off. With enough charm, he might lead her to the honeymoon suite and they'll make the cutest flavored water packets the world has ever seen.</p><p>Her BCFF Pepper was almost the embodiment of herself, but just not as good, according to Salt. She always knew what made her tick; she was, in many regards, another version of herself that somehow surfaced into the real world.</p><p>This Saturday morning was gonna be a blistering 98 degrees, and Pepper vowed to make the most out of this unusually sweltering day at the pool, which would almost certainly reach full capacity. Unfortunately, Salt was by no means a morning person, unlike herself. Their discordant circadian rhythms often left their plans as nothing more than lost causes.</p><p>She knocked on Salt's door vigorously. "Salt...¬†<b><em>Salt!</em></b>¬†I swear to god if you're not ready I'm gonna be so pressed..."</p><p>"<b>GAH!</b>¬†<b>I'M UP, I'M UP!¬†</b>Waking¬†<em>me</em>¬†up at nine in the fucking morning... you're gonna like, catch these hands, sis..."</p><p>Pepper raised an eyebrow, her left hand on her hip. "I told you about how today's gonna be a hot day; it's already like... let me just check... 76 degrees, and it's gonna be 81 by ten!"</p><p>"Go on without me... catch me sleeping til like, noon, kay sis?"</p><p>Luckily, she knew Salt's list of incentives: money, attention, iced tea, but most importantly...</p><p>"I bet OJ's gonna be there..."</p><p>In what seemed like an instant, Salt perked up.</p><p>"...in your favorite tank top..."</p><p>Salt quivered her lips, unable to resist the temptation. In the back of her mind, she knew that Pepper was just using her Achilles' heel to manipulate her, but the risk of missing out on such a hot, hunky piece of ass was too much to bear.</p><p>"He might even like, take a quick break to apply sunscreen... shirtless... He might even get Paper to help him out with it..."</p><p>Hearing the words "OJ" and "shirtless" within the same sentence, Pepper was startled by the rustling Salt was making. Just under a minute later, Salt opened the door, beach bag across her shoulder.</p><p>"Ready! Why didn't you get ready earlier, Pepper?"</p><p>She rolled her eyes in disgust. "Let's bounce already."</p><p>"*sigh,* OJ is such a snack. If he doesn't like, notice me and my hot body this time, I don't know what I'll do. He's so dreamy, his voice is like honey. Like</p><p>Pepper just vacantly stared at the wall of the second floor, replying with a bland "uh huh" every few seconds as she took swift glances at her friend</p><p>
<em>She boutta make me act up... damn... Salt really has no idea... fuck my life...</em>
</p><p>The two reach the outdoor pool area, and like the weather predicted, the pool was already bustling with activity. They took quick glances of Tissues and Cheesy splashing each other at the shallow end, Trophy taking photos of the rippling water, and Soap measuring the pool's chlorine with indicator strips.</p><p>Everybody present continued to engage in other activities, so most of the pool chairs were empty. Salt motioned to Pepper to come sit, then set their belongings down as they stripped out of their clothes to reveal a white and black bikini, respectively.</p><p>Many houseguests couldn't deny their sheer attractiveness; Salt had the bigger breasts, and Pepper had the bigger butt, but both were conventionally attractive. Despite their voluptuousness, however, their intense affinity for each other and disdain for humility was a major dealbreaker for everybody else.</p><p>Salt pulled out a bottle of tanning oil and applied it to the body parts she could reach. Pepper noticed this and got butterflies in her stomach.</p><p>"Hey, would you like, get my back?"</p><p>Pepper almost threw her breakfast back up as she blushed at the request.</p><p>"Oh... okay..."</p><p>She was tenderly rubbing Salt's back as nasty thoughts began to corrupt her mind. Thoughts of hedonism and sin clouded her judgment. Just as Pepper's excitement began to peak, she heard a faint voice ring inside her head.</p><p>"Pepper... Pepper... PEPPER!"</p><p>"GAH! O-oh, what's up, Salty Salt?"</p><p>"You can like, stop now..."</p><p>Pepper cursed under her breath, but obliged for her friend. "Did I do a good job?"</p><p>"You did fine, I guess... Oh, could you also like, watch my things? I have to powder my no-<br/>OMG, HE'S HERE!! HE'S HERE!! QUICK PEPPER, HOW DOES MY BUTT LOOK?!</p><p>Pepper rolled her eyes and groaned. She's spent an entire decade with her best friend but still lacked to decipher the reason why he was so desirable to her. OJ took his job too seriously for romance, his interests were bland, and his style...¬† totally basic, like what color was orange anyway? Orange goes with almost nothing. What kind of name is OJ anyway? Needless to say, her friend's attraction to such a straight-laced¬†<b><em>man¬†</em></b>of all things perplexed her.</p><p>"Like, what makes you think he'll thirst over you this time?"</p><p>Salt scoffed and took a deep breath. "OMG, Pepper! He's been playing hard to get, you know this! Like, he's been totally avoiding me and my endless beauty because he had like nothing to give before he won the show just like I knew he would, but now that he's rich and dreamier than ever, he'll totally want to go out with me! Not gonna lie, like I don't blame him, just look at me! I'm hot!" She posed for her friend.</p><p>
<em>The last part is true, but she's high-key crazy...</em>
</p><p><em>"</em>Major cap. First off, the hotel that he won like, eight or nine years ago? He would've given up on your ass years ago; no man is THAT desperate."</p><p>Salt gasped at the blasphemy she just witnessed. LIKE I CAN'T EVEN WITH YOU AND THIS DISRESPECT! BOO, HE LOVES ME AND HE KNOWS IT!! She turned her back on Pepper, walking as fast as she could over to OJ, who was with Paper discussing revenue projections for the summer and fall.</p><p>"I'm telling you Paper, I think we can really see growth within all demographics if we hire an experienced chef. It might be costly but hopefully we can cut back on the soggy panca‚Äî"</p><p>Salt tapped on the manager's shoulder with a sultry, lovestruck smile on her face. "Heyyy, darling. Missed me?~..."</p><p>OJ turned his head and shuddered quietly. Any hint of vivacity in his voice quickly turned into raw repugnance as he gazed into her eager eyes.</p><p>"Oh... it's you, Salt. What do you want this time?"</p><p>Salt wasted no time in selling herself, quite literally. Seductive and enticing, she sashayed in front of OJ and put a hand on his chest.</p><p>"I bet you just ADORE my brand new bikini. How it like, compliments my body and stuff, and how it like...¬†<em>leaves little to the imagination, heh heh..."¬†</em>She traced her finger around his upper body.</p><p>To Pepper, this was unbearable to watch. "Every time... SALT, LEAVE HIM ALONE!"</p><p>To say that OJ felt uncomfortable? Total understatement. He just stared at Paper, who exchanged a similar look of dread.</p><p>"Salt, not now please. I was talking to Paper about the hotel's projections for next quarter..."</p><p>Salt just chuckled as she grew defensive at her crush's priorities.</p><p>"Oh, why is it always about the hotel? Hotel this, hotel that... You are like, high-key uptight; I bet such a thirsty stud like yourself could use a cool drink of water right about now~," she insisted, slightly bending over to showcase her backside. Pepper facepalmed, disappointed in her friend's lack of boundaries.</p><p>OJ did not interact. He refused to look or even continue talking until she left. His eyes snapped shut as he crossed his arms in protest of Salt's advances.</p><p>"Oh like, come on, don't be like that. I'll let you top. You like, don't have to use any protection with me." She grabbed onto his chest and whispered into his ear.</p><p>
<em>"I'll let you do anything you want. Destroy me, OJ.</em>
</p><p>Salt may have been relentless in her pursuit for him, but OJ was just as relentless in her pursuit for anything BUT her. He stared at Paper with a reluctant look and nodded. His prot√©g√© was shocked, but nodded back, certain that what was to come earned justification for the woman's harassment.<br/><br/></p><p>OJ pushed Salt away in a moment of unapologetic agitation.</p><p>...</p><p>"Paper and I need to get back to work. Now."<br/><br/></p><p>The stubborn woman scoffed at OJ's series of defiance.</p><p>"Like whatever. Hate to throw shade, but if you trust an entire hotel on a beta soyboy like Paper, this hotel might like, need better management."</p><p>OJ's anger couldn't be contained any longer. A surge of rage flowed through his veins.</p><p>"You really don't know, don't you..."</p><p>Salt turned her head. "Like, of course I know, heh heh... okay I don't know, what do I need to know?"</p><p>Pepper intervened as her final effort to defuse the situation. "Salt, please... let it go..."</p><p>This interaction garnered the attention of multiple houseguests, their fingers hovering over the big red record button.</p><p>"You REALLY want to know huh? Suddenly THIS time is so special to you now? I've tried to make this simple idea PERFECTLY clear to you at the very least THREE TIMES A WEEK, but no, you just refuse to listen! I've met five-year olds in THIS VERY HOTEL that have more restraint, more courtesy, and ESPECIALLY more tolerance than you, Salt.¬† You know, I can endure your annoying puppy love‚Äî have been for what, like eight years now? But when you disrespect and disparage the staff member THAT WIPES YOUR ASS FOR YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE'S HERE EVERY DAY AT THIS VERY ESTABLISHMENT? Absolutely not. Now I want you to listen to me, and listen to me carefully‚Äîyour thick skull might miss what I'm about to say.</p><p>...<br/><br/></p><p>I'm gay. 100%, absolutely, super-duper-mega gay. I cheer for the same team, I don't know how else to say it. I'm gay for Paper and I always have been. I've never liked you as a person, and I definitely don't like you as a significant other, so the moment you insulted him, you insulted me.</p><p>Salt's world shattered. "I‚Äî"</p><p>"<b>U N D E R S T A N D ? ! ? I WON'T HESITATE IN EVICTING YOU!"</b></p><p>Her lips tightly sealed, a teary-eyed Salt ran out of the pool entrance. She wasn't very well received by other guests, so a bit of applause came afterwards as the recordings came to a halt. Pepper's first instinct was to scurry after her for consolation, but she soon realized she needed to give this one time.</p><p>Pepper walked towards the hotel's owner. "OJ? I know this is a little weird coming from me, but I just wanted to say... thanks."</p><p>"Thanks? But I told your best friend off!"</p><p>"Yeah, well, somebody needed to. Don't tell her this, but I've... been crushing on Salt for like YEARS now. Do you think you could... I dunno... reserve the honeymoon suite for us?"</p><p>"Hold that thought." OJ looked at his phone and checked if any guests would be reserving the precious space for the night. "Looks like you got yourselves a vacancy! I'll buy some, ahem... "saucy"¬† items for you two; the quicker Salt forgets about me, the better. Meet me at 8:00 tonight to pick them up."</p><p>"Thanks OJ! I like, really appreciate it!"</p><p>He grabbed Paper by the waist and kissed him on the lips as the two waved her goodbye and wished her luck.</p><p>"Um, I'm gonna have to clean up after them, aren't I, honey bun?" Paper said sheepishly.</p><p>OJ laughed. "Oh Paper... yes, yes you do."</p><p>When Pepper returned to her room an hour later, she noticed Salt had fallen asleep, which gave her the perfect opportunity to coax her into the honeymoon suite. Thankful of the quiet carpet floor, she crept over to the workstation adjacent to the kitchen area and composed an anonymous note, which she placed ever so gently on Salt's nightstand.</p><p>8:30 PM. Salt woke up a groggy and miserable woman as the love of her life chastised her in front of the entire hotel. She put on a comfy white sweater, grabbed the remote, and reached for an entire tub of H√§agen-Dazs to wallow in her sadness. Right as she was about to sit back down into bed, she quickly noticed a note with her name on the nightstand. She flipped the note over and was utterly dumbfounded by its contents.</p><p>
<em>Salt -</em>
</p><p>
<em>You had a rough day, haven't you? Well, why don't you come on over to the honeymoon suite, room 108, and I'll make it up to you. I'm sure it'll be worth your while~</em>
</p><p>
<em>Signed,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Your Secret Admirer</em>
</p><p>In an immediate turn of events, Salt's lethargy turned into liveliness.</p><p>"O. M. G... OJ TOOK ME BACK! I JUST KNOW HE'D COME TO MY RESCUE!!"</p><p>Such an invitation filled her to the brim with adrenaline, her head clouded with dopamine thinking about the lecherous acts they were going to perform. Salt rushed out of the door, still wearing her dinky white sweatshirt and leggings and knocked onto room 108. No answer.</p><p>Desperate to enter the suite, she tugged onto the door handle and tripped inside‚Äî the door was unlocked. She darted her eyes around the room, but OJ was nowhere to be found.</p><p>"OJ? OJ, my baby, like, don't be shy! I just want to talk!"</p><p>Salt heard the faint sound of another being lurking in the distance. When the being revealed itself, she was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>Pepper took a slow, sultry bite out of some gourmet chocolates as she was stepping forward. "What's happenin', babe?"</p><p>Speechless, Salt raised a finger up in confusion. "Like, what are you doing here?"</p><p>"Duh, the note said to come to the honeymoon suite, so I did. Pretty simple, if I do say so myself..."</p><p>"YOU'RE my secret admirer?!?"</p><p>Pepper took a deep breath. "In the flesh. I'm surprised you never noticed literally years ago. Earlier today I almost had like a heart attack or something when I massaged your back. Thing is, you... radiate beauty. You get hotter every time I see you. Your confidence, your sassiness ... makes me act up every time! I know it must've hurt quite a bit when OJ straight up ripped you a new one at the pool, but you were barking up the wrong tree for like, way too long. I'm not saying we should cuff, but, like, I hope that a special night together could help you forget that boring ass man and teach you what an enchanting¬†<b><em>woman</em></b>¬†could do to scratch that... special itch~," she cooed as she sensually stripped out of her favorite crop top and low-rise jeans.</p><p>Salt stood still, as motionless as a subject in a painting. "Whoa... I like, never experimented with a girl before‚Äî all those years trying to chase OJ's heart must have like, messed with my head or something to the point where I completely forgot I was even into girls like,¬†<em>at all!</em>¬†I'm down; show me a good time, doll~."</p><p>Pepper licked her lips as she walked closer. "You made an excellent choice."</p><p>She took Salt by the hands and navigated her to what was probably the best bed in the house: a red velvet California king with black pillows and a heart-shaped bedpost. She stripped Salt of her clothes one by one as she delicately pinned her best friend down onto the silky smooth red fabric.</p><p>Pepper grabbed a vibrator and carefully slicked it into Salt's slit, turning it on to the medium setting. She began to cup her breasts one by one, immediately followed by both at the same time, marveling in those soft, sensitive mounds of hers.</p><p>She went one step further and began to slowly place her tongue onto her left nipple, sucking slowly due to the sensitivity.</p><p>"D...definitely my b-best asset, hahhh~..."</p><p>Pepper took the vibrator out and decided to pleasure her manually. She squatted down and began to lick her delicate flower in slow, little circles.</p><p>"AHH, RIGHT THERE! R-right there, mmm~..."</p><p>Pepper stopped at her clit, replacing slow circles for fast flicking. Salt was in a deep state of euphoria, the waves of pleasure flowing through her body at its purest form.¬† She bucked her hips forward, body shaking and squirming from the girl's masterful performance as she had a ferociously powerful orgasm.</p><p>"Oh my god... holy... I think it's... GGGAAUUUGHHH!"</p><p>Pepper pulled her face away from Salt's lips and smacked her ass, grabbing the lube from OJ's gift bag.</p><p>"Your body is such a delight, Salt... Let's take this to the next level, my pretty little pillow princess~." Salt, her headspace still very much on another planet, was groaning in pleasure from the afterglow. Pepper moved directly on top of the busty girl, straddling her legs onto her back, getting into position for the grand finale that soon was to come.</p><p>"Prepare yourself~..."</p><p>Pepper sprayed some lube onto her crotch before securely lowering herself onto Salt's needy entrance. The two were as unhinged as wild animals as they began to exchange their sexual energies‚Äîthe primal groans and dirty sounds excited each other to no end.</p><p>"Uhhhnnn... P-pepper.... Ride me l-like a wild animal~!"</p><p>Pepper chuckled sensually. "Mmm... d-don't think a man can do that, huh?"</p><p>Salt grabbed the ends of the sheets forcefully as her wet flower was being invaded with the finest grace. Time stopped to a halt as both lovers felt the world stopped just for their own pleasures to intertwine.</p><p>Pepper gripped Salt's ample breasts vigorously, her shifty hands twiddling her sensitive nipples yet again. Salt started to rub her clit to intensify her best friend's tactile stimulation.</p><p>As their bodily fluids weaved together, it was evident that orgasm was approaching fast. In a matter of mere seconds, Pepper completely lowered herself onto Salt's curvy body as she squirted her clear fluid onto herself. It oozed into her pussy and onto the bed like butter. Salt's orgasm followed suit with no fluids, echoing Pepper's moans.</p><p>The two got into the covers during the afterglow. Salt reached for Pepper's waist, rubbing it and kissing her soft cheeks.</p><p>"Thanks for such a magical night, boo~."</p><p>The two nuzzled into each other's heads, kissing each other goodnight before quickly drifting off to sleep.</p>

<h2 class="heading">Fan X Test Tube (NSFW - Request)</h2>
<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This repeat of the same ship comes from a request that came on Wattpad, the place where I originally posted all of these stories.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>"...Aaaaaaand it looks like The Thinkers face another night on the chopping block!"</p><p>Paintbrush's face swiftly transitioned from one of neutrality to one of intense exasperation. "COME ON, TEAM! WE HAD THIS SHIT!¬†<em>Sigh,¬†</em>I should've seen this coming from the start...</p><p>The Pinkers exchanged a scattered phase of high-fives, sighs of relief, and gelatinous high-energy vibrations from Goo. Delighted to experience the privilege of avoiding a worrying elimination ceremony, the team decided to partake in ample celebration.</p><p>Fan motioned over to Test Tube and hugged her passionately; she quickly returned the gesture with a warm smile that adorned her face.</p><p>"Fan, I'm beaming with delight knowing that I can guarantee another few days with you on my side. I'm as excitable as pure sodium reacting in water!" The scientist chuckled at her little science reference.</p><p>Fan didn't know exactly what she meant by that, but it didn't matter to him‚Äîhe was just lucky to spend some extra time with his... best friend? Girlfriend? Friend with benefits? He couldn't exactly pinpoint where their relationship was heading now that they got intimate a while back.</p><p>Fan laughed shyly. "Heh, thanks Testy, that means a lot... truly."</p><p>"No problem," Test Tube replied. "Oh Fan, I've been a little distracted with my studies recently, so I haven't had the time to debrief you on this, but I was... wondering if you could stop by my lab later tonight to, erm, experiment. It's um, of utmost importance, heh heh..."</p><p>"You built ANOTHER lab? On a secluded island?"</p><p>The geeky girl pushed her glasses up towards the bridge of her nose. "Sure did. The construction was simple structural engineering, and I always bring a handy supply of beakers and flasks when I depart for long trips, sometimes a buret if I'm a little adventurous, no biggie."</p><p>Fan just stood there blankly, dumbfounded expression and all. "Cool... whatever floats your boat, I guess..."</p><p>Test Tube gasped at the blasphemy she just witnessed. "So insensitive! Had Boaty still floated on the seven seas, he'd blow his horn with fiery wrath! Ahem... I apologize. Just meet me later tonight at the lab and wash your hands at the entrance."</p><p>Fan nodded with that puzzled look on his face and began walking in the other direction as he waved to his... yeah, it's complicated.</p><p>
<b>5 HOURS LATER</b>
</p><p>Test Tube looked at her body in the mirror stoically. Little to Fan's knowledge, the lab she built far surpassed the need for scientific exploration.</p><p>"Golly, I hope that he'll like what he sees. What if he doesn't find me attractive this time? I'm not quite the Hollywood starlet myself..." Test Tube wasn't as busty as some of the other girls she's come across, which often obliterated any shred of body positivity left in her mind. She knew Fan had feelings for her; he really demonstrated it back on the island weeks ago, but she really wanted to show him the adoration for the tech-savvy geek she grew to love so much over the years.</p><p>She was about to change into something a bit more comfortable, but she got a text from Fan.</p><p>üéê<br/>üì±¬†<em>On my way to the lab. Say, how do I know I found it?</em></p><p>üì±<em>¬†Assuming you're departing from living quarters, head about half a mile due east. You know you're on the right track when you see the mossy tree.</em></p><p>Fan liked her response with a üëçüèª. Test Tube's heart rate was increasing at an alarming rate as she found herself seeping with adrenaline. She found herself quickly scrambling for some decent mascara or some kind of enhancer. "I'm a scientist; I've bound to have made some kind of aesthetic ray or blaster for¬†<em>somebody</em>¬†at some point in time!"</p><p>After a bout of calculated scavenging, the scientist gasped quietly in delight and quickly applied some mascara she got for Christmas as a tacky Secret Santa gift. Poor thing was on sale, price tag still on the packaging and all.</p><p>Within a matter of seconds, Test Tube heard the startling pounding of the metallic door. Her adrenaline kicked in almost instantly, changing into the cheesiest periodic table shirt she could find and a pair of skinny jeans.</p><p>"Welcome, Fan! Please come in!"</p><p>"Heh, thanks," Fan commented as his eyes darted at the graphic tee she was wearing.</p><p>"I only wear this shirt... periodically. That's uh, that's funny," he said, chuckling out of sympathy.</p><p>Test Tube blushed at the compliment, albeit disingenuous.</p><p>"So Testy, what was the experiment you were talking about earlier today? If I can guess what I'm testing, you owe me a Dr. Fizz! Let's see... is it a shovel that can dig all the way to the center of the Earth?"</p><p>Test Tube rolled her eyes. "Keep hypothesizing, ya big goof, not quite."</p><p>Fan quizzically looked at the ceiling. "How about X-ray goggles?"</p><p>Test Tube shook her head.</p><p>"Are you making a serum that can make your hair the silkiest and the smoothest? How about a device that can make me the fastest texter in the world? Maybe a switch to change personalities at will? It¬†<b>HAS</b>¬†to be that; I've seen the way you look at Cabby!"</p><p>Test Tube was blushing a deep shade of cherry red. "Haha, no, no, and I wish, but not now. I was focusing on a collaborative procedure we could work on together... you know, something a little more...¬†<em>hands-on..."</em></p><p>With the press of a tiny switch she was holding behind her back, a hidden doorway suddenly popped into existence. Gesturing Fan to follow her in, the two greeted themselves to a dimly-lit bedroom that was playing some quiet smooth jazz. Inside was a king-size bed adorned with the finest Goiky silk and purple LED lights around the walls of the room.</p><p>Fan was getting desperate for answers. "Uh, Testy, what... is this?"</p><p>Test Tube was very close to shaking from the deception and came clean. "Alright, I'll talk! I didn't actually want to perform some usual experiment with you this time, Fan. Truth is... please don't get mad at me... but I, uh, hoped to coax you into my lab so I could engage in a modest session of... ardent copulation with you."</p><p>Fan raised an eyebrow. "English, please?"</p><p>Test Tube took a deep breath and palmed her hands together. "Fan... I want t-to have sex with you. Two weeks ago, y-you gave such an enjoyable sensation of oral and tactile simulations to my... um... nether regions that it left me absolutely ravenous for recreating that intoxicating feeling, preferably something more, something far <em>stronger,¬†</em>heh heh...</p><p>Fan's eyes opened wide at the confession as he felt a familiar feeling emerge at the pit of his stomach. "You want to have sex with me?"</p><p>Test Tube nodded. "Y-yep. I'm um... horny for some 'friction.'" Test Tube walked behind Fan and slowly led him to the bed. She gave him a little push, letting him fall freely on his back. Her hands reached for his sweatpants and quickly pulled them down as impure thoughts invaded the far reaches of her mind. Eager for the treasure inside, she grabbed the sides of his underwear and removed them in one fell swoop, marveling at the oscillation of his member.</p><p>Fan gasped at the suddenness of her actions. "Testy, w-what's gotten into you? Not that I'm against it, of course~," he flirted playfully.</p><p>Test Tube didn't say a thing, simply reciprocating a series of chuckles as she removed her pants. She walked over to a half-naked Fan and squatted down onto the bed, stroking his erection slowly. With the widest smile imaginable, she petted his head with her other hand.</p><p>She gave a quick smooch on the tip of Fan's length,¬† and hoisted herself on top of her aroused partner, grabbing his dick in an attempt to align it with her folds.</p><p>"Ready sweetie?"</p><p>As soon as Fan have a nod of approval, Test Tube lowered herself onto him. The two held hands tightly and stared into each other as their smiling faces gleamed with radiance. Once Test Tube gained a steady rhythm riding her lover's manhood, she began to sway her hips rhythmically. The undulations only added to Fan's lust as he felt a sudden loss of control. The sensation robbed him of his inhibitions; his peripheral vision started to vanish, his eyes completely locked on the researcher's sacred regions.</p><p><em>There's no going back now,¬†</em>Fan echoed in his head, his heart rate skyrocketing in an instant. "Testy... this feels...¬†<em>mmm...</em>amazing..."</p><p>She chuckled at his compliment, repositioning her hands to Fan's warm chest. The heat alone subconsciously led her fingers to glide through her damp entrance.</p><p>After a few minutes, Test Tube got up off of the bed and laid on her back. Desperate for stimulation, she fondled her body, waiting for Fan to make his move.</p><p>"Fan, please... D-don't hold back... Tonight, I'm the experiment.~"</p><p>Swooning from the intimacy, Fan felt his erection twitching like it had a mind of its own. Fan took off his shirt and grinded against Test Tube's wetness, making a harsh¬†<em>shlick</em>¬†from the friction.</p><p>"STOP TEASING, JUST PUT IT IN ME!!"</p><p>Fan reflexively jumped back from the volume of her pleas, but grabbed his penis in an instant, slowly inserting his own length inside.</p><p>"Ohhhohoho, so... warm... so dirty~..."</p><p>Almost instantly, Test Tube body tensed from the pressure. Her eyes rolled back from the overwhelming pleasure and dug her fingers into the bedsheets. With every powerful thrust, the scientist grunted in delight as her tongue popped out like a panting dog.</p><p>"...mmm... F-f-Fan, h-harder... just k-keep going... as fast as you can..."</p><p>"You're the boss, Testy."</p><p>Fan grabbed Testy's sides and slowly increased the pace of his thrusting. He couldn't help but subconsciously high-five himself as he heard familiar 50s Transatlantic exclamations peep from his lover. Those went a long way, but Fan's mind was focused on other ideas.</p><p>Test Tube covered her mouth as the moans intensified. Her mind slowly chugged along, struggling to find the words she needed to communicate her immense desire for the force of her boy-toy.</p><p>"M-more...more...more...more...gimme more..."</p><p>As her requests became incessantly louder and quicker, Fan had to recede from his prior pace to avoid a premature conclusion to the bodily symphony in progress.</p><p>Fan paused briefly, fiddled with the hem of Test Tube's shirt, then slowly rose it upward to reveal the rest of her. Her body was relatively fit from all the experimental activity that her body supported, and her breasts, while not as large as Tea Kettle's voluptuous mounds, were large enough for Fan to lose his mind over.</p><p>Fan grabbed Test Tube's bare waist and resumed his previous thrusting speed. She bit her lip as each sloppy¬†<em>plap</em>¬†sound got louder and faster.</p><p>Test Tube wrapped her smooth, pale legs around Fan's waist. "Ahhhh... f-f-FUCK... oh my god...</p><p>Fan consistently shifted his eyes to Test Tube's boobs, and as she took notice, she hoped to make something sexy out of it.</p><p>"Well well well," Test Tube said with a chuckle, "who's this little pervert? Looking at my breasts again? Tsk, tsk, tsk..."</p><p>Fan moaned quietly: "I c-can't help it... they're just longing for attention, s-slaving away inside your shirt,¬†<em>a-ah,¬†</em>they needed to be let free..,"</p><p>Test Tube lowered her hands down and started to aggressively masturbate. "<em>Hmm...¬†</em>you a-animal... r-release yourself onto me...¬†<em>o-oh f-fuck</em>, p-please."</p><p>"Testy... h-hahhhh... I'm... I-I'm getting close...!"</p><p>Test Tube smiled, her hands interlocking with her lover's as she prepared for orgasm.</p><p>"Oh, Fan... t-tell me you got the cream..."</p><p>"Y-yes... y-yes I've g-got the cream..."</p><p>Her words were fast and almost incomprehensible from the pleasure at this point. "<em>unnnh,¬†</em>I want your c-cum so b-badly! Please!"</p><p>Fan groped Test Tube's right breast before pulling out. She played with her breasts and pushed them together as she braced for impact. With a swift warning, the two lovers moaned in beautiful cacophony as they watched ropes of Fan's viscous seed cover her tummy and chest.</p><p>As Fan squeezed out his last drop of cum, he slapped his dick on Test Tube's breasts to dry it off, the scientist laughing at the gesture. Fan got up from the bed to admire his lover's handiwork, the sight so magical to him that he felt a small twitch.</p><p>Test Tube coaxed Fan to lay on the bed with her. The two locked lips as they played with their genitalia.</p><p>Test Tube let go of the kisses: "Fan... that was... exhilarating... that was quite a lot," she said, blushing.</p><p>Fan blushed at the compliment. "I couldn't ask for anything better. Hey, this might be a little weird, but uh, may I?"</p><p>"May I what, Fan?" Fan pointed to her breasts.</p><p>Test Tube giggled, "Oh alright, you can go to town with them, but not for too long, please! I have to get cleaned up."</p><p>Fan quickly smooched her cheek. "Thanks for a wonderful night Testy," he said warmly as he cupped both of her perfect boobs.</p>

<h2 class="heading">Nickel X Balloon (NSFW - REQUEST)</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Nickel was walking to a shady palm tree to distract himself from the extreme events that transpired from the egg challenge a week prior. Being perennial losers decimated his morale, and with Box's untimely departure from the show, he yearned for some connection to replace the special relationship he had with Box.</p><p>Sour from the loss of perfection incarnate, a gaping hole in his chest widened as the only tolerable person on this entire show suffered a crippling musculoskeletal affliction. The only person left that seemed to support him unconditionally was Balloon, so he had to suffice.</p><p><em>"</em>Hey, Nickel!" Balloon exclaimed.</p><p>Nickel laid against a palm tree with an annoyed expression, offering nothing but an amalgamation of uncertainty and grief as he gazed at the one who once consistently wronged him.</p><p>"Uh, Nickel? Nickel?"</p><p>"Oh, I heard you; I just couldn't really think of a reason to have a conversation without rolling my eyelids into the back of my brain. Ugh... I hope Clover dies in a dark fucking alleyway for what she did! Dumb bitch..."</p><p>Balloon's welcoming grin turned into genuine concern instantaneously. "Whoa, whoa, whoa, relax! Uhhhh, you alright, buddy? You're acting less like yourself and more like Trophy... or Knife..."</p><p>"Oh no, Balloon, absolutely¬†<em>nothing¬†</em>is wrong at all!</p><p>"Got it, you're fuming. Any chance I can be a friend lending a helping hand?"</p><p>"Cut the sappy shit, Balloon!"</p><p>Balloon scowled at his skinny friend. "Hey, cut it out! Being angry is one thing, but the unnecessary displacement of your emotions is another! It's either you tell me what's causing distress, or you keep quiet and push your concerns down until it kills you. So... Nickel... what's it gonna be?"</p><p>Nickel leered back at his teammate. "Ugh, FUCK, I hate it when you're r-r-r"</p><p>"When I'm what? Sorry, I can't hear you," Balloon taunted.</p><p>¬†"I said I hate it when you're r-r-i-g... when you're r-i-... OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN!"</p><p>Balloon chuckled and rolled his eyes. "You arrogant dork, haha! I'm just kidding, heh heh, spit it out, buddy..."</p><p>"<em>Sigh...¬†</em>okay... As annoying as Lifering's lame-ass optimism was, he gave us some decent plans and made me work less. Tea Kettle was fun to fuck with, and Box? That guy will always be a fuckin' legend, and he's gone now... So yeah, everything's hunky-dory!"</p><p>Balloon sighed heavily as he tried to process Nickel's grief. "So what you're trying to say is that the absence of our fellow teammates is starting to bum you out?"</p><p>Nickel scowled at the fact that he was right. "Yeah, sure, whatever, what of it?"</p><p>Balloon discarded the attitude and continued with his psychoanalysis. "I think you're starting to feel the initial stages of grief. It's just an inevitable part of life - what is will not continue to be. Nobody... chooses bereavement, but it... chooses us. You miss Box because you loved him, and if that's not the case, you're probably grieving for yourself and for the life that you once knew. I also think that Lifering and Tea Kettle's departures from the show contributed somewhat, but Box was the driving force behind the repressed emotion."</p><p>"W-whoa... Uhm, I mean, that may be true, but how do you know that for sure? Box and I had... a very special connection; you wouldn't understand."</p><p>Balloon was mildly discouraged but continued to press on for his friend. "W-well, I knew you two were quite close, but if you told me some details of the moments you enjoyed the most while you were together, you might feel better, maybe even achieve some closure. Is that okay?</p><p>"Do you really want to know, Balloon? You REALLY want to try and fix me?" Nickel exclaimed, his head falling in despair."</p><p>Balloon felt a strange concoction of frustration due to Nickel's uncooperative display and anger that he still had trouble believing in him despite all the changes he knew he had made.¬†</p><p>"Come on, Nickel, don't word it like that! If you want to live your life trapped behind an impenetrable wall, be my guest, but I'm sure as heck that I'm not going to let you wallow in your pain all by yourself! So... yeah... I'm just trying to help. To be honest, I'm not sure if anybody else will offer assistance given how polarized the teams have become. So again, Nickel... what's it gonna be?"</p><p>Nickel grunted softly as he sat on a tree stump, unhappy that he was conceding.¬†<em>Balloon is the last person I'd "tAlK aBoUt mY fEeLinGs tO." What other choice do I have?</em></p><p>"*sigh...* Balloon... Box and I... we... we were going to be so much more..."</p><p>Balloon looked at the skinnier man quizzically: "What do you mean?"</p><p>"...w-well, when we were together in the hotel, and even during off days during this season, we would just... lose control. When everybody was out doing some sort of activity at Hotel OJ, Box and I would act sick so we would have our alone time without anybody noticing. I've been so lonely ever since I was separated from my boyfriend, so I needed a substitute to really satisfy my... urges, if you know what I mean. I thought Box and I were only gonna be friends with benefits, but the more I actively listened to what he had to offer, I started to develop feelings. And now that he's been struck by that lucky, privileged BASTARD... " Nickel's fists started to clench.</p><p>Balloon grabbed Nickel's hands and blushed slightly. "Hey hey, it's ok..."</p><p>¬†"Wait, does Baseball know that you're cheating on him with Box?"</p><p>Nickel laughed. "Heh, I'm not cheating on him. Besides, we flirted with the idea of non-monogamy and polyamory, so the risk that he'll get mad at me is probably very low.¬†</p><p>Balloon felt a little uneasy with this sudden information dump. "I-I see... Well, there is a chance that Box will turn out fine from this. I mean, he¬†<b><em>is</em>¬†</b>Box, after all."</p><p>Nickel grunted softly but exchanged eye contact with Balloon. "I hope so. Otherwise, Clover's gonna fuckin pay."</p><p>"Hey, Balloon?"</p><p>"Yes, Nickel?"</p><p>Nickel grabbed Balloon by his soft, tender hands and cupped them into his, looking down at the ground as the embarrassment took over.</p><p>"As annoying as you can be sometimes, you... weren't bad this time, so good job I guess," he said quickly, looking at Balloon quickly and giving a faint smirk. "I'd go to the pic-nix tables, but I'm banned, so would you mind whipping up some spaghetti for me? Anyways, I gotta go, bye."</p><p>Balloon placed both hands on his chest as he felt a certain sensation in his groin. "Y-yeah...b-bye Nickel~..."</p><p>¬†</p><p>¬†</p><p>A few days passed, and Nickel's grief was advancing normally. Balloon had believed that he witnessed him during the anger stage because he saw him begging MePhone to resurrect Box if he could a day later, but it would compromise the delicate fabric of the space-time continuum. He occupied the Calm Down Cabana for an egregious amount of time lamenting for two days, but afterward, his temperament was relatively normal.¬†</p><p>As time went on, Balloon became infatuated with the lean sarcastic machine. The only reason as to why Balloon knows Nickel's grief process was because he spent hours remaining close by his side, sometimes to monitor any emotional deviation and other times to daydream about... other things.¬†</p><p>The following day, Balloon woke up with a particularly hard problem. Pulling up the covers to ensure that Nickel didn't see, he watched Nickel get ready with one eye open, which exacerbated his little "problem" of his.</p><p>When Balloon was certain he left, he removed his pants and his briefs and instantaneously put his hands on his girthy penis. Short, heavy breaths escaped his mouth as his cock continued to twitch.¬†<em>So good</em>, he thought to himself as a familiar¬†<em>plap, plap, plap</em>¬†invaded the acoustics of the bunkroom.¬†He would constantly look left and right to keep watch, but his prime objective was pleasure.</p><p>"Fuck, N-nickel, oh god..."¬†</p><p>Considerable progress was made as he began to fantasize about his slender teammate hoisting him up and slamming him down onto a California king bed with velvet sheets and silk pillows. Balloon longed for Nickel's sinewy touch as lavender and sandalwood incense intoxicate the two with desire.¬†</p><p>Balloon bit his lip, increasing the pace. Vivid thoughts of Nickel sucking him off obliterated any shred of reasoning, as there was no turning back.¬†</p><p>"N-Nickel, please... c-claim me as y-yours! Ungh, ohhhh~," he exclaimed as he passed the peak of orgasm.¬†</p><p>"Balloon, what the fuck are you doing?" Nickel questioned, mouth agape.</p><p>"NICKEL! OH MY GOD!" Balloon yelped, jumping out of bed reflexively.¬†</p><p>"HOLY SHIT!" Nickel shouted, averting his gaze. His general curiosity led him to uncover his eyes to investigate, but Balloon grabbed the comforter before he could thoroughly investigate.</p><p>"NICKEL, I'M SO SORRY! PLEASE FORGIVE ME!" Balloon cried. He looked down with regret, witnessing months of repair shatter in front of his very eyes.¬†</p><p>"Balloon, relax!"¬†</p><p>...</p><p>Nickel took notice of Balloon tearing up and shaking, his back turned against him.¬†<em>Jesus, I really don't want to do this... ugh...</em></p><p>Nickel rubbed his shoulder tenderly and whispered in his ear. "Balloon, it's alright. It's going to be okay. Look at me... look at me... C'mon, snap out of it Balloon," he commanded softly.</p><p>Balloon looked up and saw his teammate smirk at him delicately.</p><p>"I'm not angry. Deep breaths: in, out... in, out... in, out... there ya go, do you feel any better?"</p><p>Balloon nodded silently, reclaiming the courage to return eye contact.</p><p>"So... what are you gonna do, knowing that you've seen my... you know," Balloon blushed potently.</p><p>Nickel stared idly at the ground, unable to make heads or tails of the situation, and smiled devilishly.</p><p>"Well, I could just walk away now and pretend like this day so far never happened, but that's¬†<em>soo</em>¬†much fun. What if, instead of that, I... you know...¬†<em>make things even</em>¬†</p><p>Balloon started to feel dizzy. The blood that circulated in his head seemed to have rushed down to his penis in a matter of seconds as the shy Sinker was at full mast despite cumming once already. His thoughts were racing, conscience working overtime as he thought of all the possible ways that a sexual interaction could blossom or tarnish their budding friendship.</p><p>"Uhmm, well uh, hmm, I-I-I d-don't know... I-I thought y-you'd be s-saving yourself for Box or B-Baseball, right?"¬†</p><p>Nickel scoffed casually and laughed. "As I said, the door is always open. The hinges are about to burst, too...~"</p><p>"W-well, you d-definitely seem to be i-in to the idea..."</p><p>Nickel took off his pants and underwear, deciding to showcase his six-inch treasure to his new confidant. "Is¬†<em>this</em>¬†clear enough for you?"</p><p>Balloon gawked, trodding closer to his half-naked body. His eyes were deadlocked on the fleshy organ as he desired nothing but his savory seed percolating in his orifices.¬†</p><p>NIckel sat down on the bottom bunk, and without hesitation stripped Balloon of the rest of his clothes. He then lightly pushed his teammate onto the bed and cupped his soft, plushie-like skin with his calloused fingers.</p><p>"Suck it. Now," Nickel commanded.</p><p>Balloon obliged like the subservient little vassal he was and got to work, first stroking his member a few times to gain a foothold then taking his entire length slowly. He rested his clammy hands onto Nickel's thighs and slowly started to bob his head up and down. Everything seemed natural until the sarcastic Sinker quickly pulled him away as he started to hear him gag.</p><p>"Balloon, you idiot, you gotta breathe with your nose! Breathe with your nose, man!"</p><p>After he caught his breath, the heavy-set fellow grunted and coughed slightly. "Heh heh, sorry...," he responded bashfully. "Okay, let's try this one more time..."</p><p>Nickel kept a close watch on Balloon as his penis was enveloped into Balloon's wide-open mouth, ensuring he'd still be alive after he sucked him dry. He struggled for a few more seconds; fortunately, he grasped the technique, thus continuing the process.</p><p>"<em>Mmm</em>, n-not bad,¬†<em>ungh</em>, n-not bad..."</p><p>Encouraged by his "kind" words, Balloon sped up his performance. He looked up at Nickel's face and winked before kissing the tip of his sopping cock while performing a delicate dance with his balls. Nickel groaned but internally became smitten with how willing he was to please.</p><p>A few seconds later, Balloon ditched sucking and went straight to what he hoped to be Nickel's greatest handjob yet. He rubbed his hands together for friction and began to stroke, watching his fingers glide seamlessly against the hardened organ. He gave a quick glance to his more dominant teammate and chuckled.</p><p>"Heh heh... y-you're so cute~."</p><p>Nickel blushed a prominent shade of crimson. "Oh, s-shut your yap and k-keep going before I¬†<em>really</em>¬†show you who's the boss around here!"</p><p>Balloon rolled his eyes and elicited a cheeky gasp: "Oh no, not that..."</p><p>"H-how did you¬†<em>oh, fuck¬†</em>get so g-good at t-this? Y-you give off the b-biggest virgin energy e-ever..."</p><p>"Let's just say that I practice a lot, but you never gave me the time of day when you constantly shunned me. But that doesn't matter anymore, because now I can play with your beautiful cock any time I want! Nickel blushed at his saucy remark. "Easy..."</p><p><em>A few minutes later</em>...</p><p>"I wonder when this vessel is going to blow," he said with a chortle, tugging on the shaft of Nickel's penis. "You've been such a trooper for so long; it's going to happen sometime! I just hope it doesn't get all over my face...~"</p><p>Nickel was as red as a beet; he rarely lasted over eight minutes, and with Balloon coaxing him to cum every thirty seconds, it wasn't the easiest task to hold it all in. His short grunts transformed into guttural moans while Balloon's delicate interplay of his puffy fingers rotated around his needy dick like a ballerina dancer's pirouette.¬†</p><p>"B-balloon, I think I'm g-gonna c-cum," Nickel uttered.</p><p><em>Y-yes</em>, Balloon thought to himself as he began to suck Nickel's dick so fast he felt as if his spine was mangled, but he didn't care. All that mattered was his sticky seed.</p><p>With a few high-impact grunts, he felt Nickel's cock twitch sporadically inside of his mouth, releasing thick strands of piping hot semen onto his tongue.¬†</p><p>¬†</p><p>"<em>Whew</em>, I can't believe I'm saying this, Balloon, but you're... actually worth keeping around quite a bit, in more ways than one. That was fucking amazing."</p><p>Balloon booped Nickel's nose and gave the most dimple-studded smile he could muster. "Aww, I'm flattered. I have a lot of practice."</p><p>"What, with yourself in the bathroom like a cuck?"</p><p>Balloon flicked his forehead. "Oh, come on, you didn't even use that word correctly! Ok, sure, but this isn't necessarily my first rodeo. What do you think of that,¬†<em>hmm</em>?"¬†</p><p>Nickel crossed his arms confidently and gave him a mischievous look. "Whatever. With that chode of yours, you really have to prove that you can absolutely wreck me like Baseball. You up for it later today?"</p><p>Balloon kissed the tip of his nose. "Only if you can return the favor..."</p><p>¬†</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>This is going to be a LONG story. I tried to keep it short, but I had so much fun writing this one that I ended up getting a little bit carried away. If you like it, great! If not, I'll try my best to improve next time - maybe send a request while you're at it :)</p><p>Bottle was an optimistic girl, always living life with a smile on her face and a thumbs-up in both hands. She was a free-spirited humanitarian living at her own pace, consistently filling the role as the quintessential happy-go-lucky do-gooder. Being the co-founder of DEATH P.A.C.T. in high school allowed her to garner some outside respect, but more often than not, she was just the token "eco-warrior" to the majority of the student body. Fortunately, Bottle reclaimed the moniker with pride.</p><p>Although her experiences through four years of death prevention and environmental altruism went a long way, they failed to translate well in academia. While her good friend Remote took every Advanced Placement class available and got consistent 5s, Bottle struggled with the rigor of coursework, so much so that her counselor would hold her back a year later than all her friends had her work failed to improve.</p><p>The future looked grim for the poor girl until a young Australian transfer named Tree moved from Adelaide her junior year. She always laughed at his funny name; it¬†<em>must be an Australian thing¬†</em>was her go-to justification. Tree joined DEATH P.A.C.T. that year. His reception of his other teammates was mixed, but initially, he portrayed Bottle as too silly and childish for him to honestly try and get to know; however, an urgent state of affairs would crumble the foundation of this sentiment.<br/><br/><br/></p><p>
<b>Junior year - December 10, 2018</b>
</p><p>Bottle went to Remote's house to try and receive some extra help for finals next week, especially for her math class.</p><p>"I think I'm gonna do GREAT in algebra! This is easy! I just gotta know that letters are sometimes numbers, and I'm good to go!</p><p>Remote slapped her hand into her face. "Bottle, please focus. I am trying to help you navigate an entire semester's worth of material, and we are currently on the second chapter! Besides, should you be concerned that you now have a D+ average?</p><p>"You worry too much," she chuckled, taking a bite out of the seaweed that she forgot to eat during lunch. "I know what I'm doing!"</p><p>Remote crossed her arms. "Truly one who calls themselves proficient in elementary algebraic expressions would have the necessary strategies to solve this: 15+6x=45+8x.</p><p>The ditzy girl immediately looked in horror as she witnessed what looked like hieroglyphs. "<em>Pfft</em>, no biggie! I, uh... umm... add the two together and hope for the best?"</p><p>Remote shook her head. "Ok... How about 3x+4=16?"</p><p>Bottle laughed at the problem. "Duh, 16! Give me a harder one!"</p><p>"x+1=3?!?"</p><p>"4! And it's an even number, so it checks out!"</p><p>Remote's stomach dropped, realizing the dire situation her friend was in. "Incorrect, the answer is 2. Bottle, I do not like to speak pessimistically, but I am afraid you are far from ready to receive a satisfactory grade for the semester. I'm not sure if you failed to learn from my instruction adequately, but... how should I say this... you cannot excel academically.</p><p>Bottle's resting smile vanished. "So what you're saying is I'm stupid?"</p><p>"Of course not; your contributions towards DEATH P.A.C.T. are astounding! However, it is of my own volition that I remind you that a professional death preventer should be well-versed in multiple types of situations... and in my opinion, that includes knowledge of rudimentary mathematics..."</p><p>Bottle gave a heart-wrenching look of remorse for her wrongdoings, then smiled instantly. "Hey, I may be stupid, but I'm NOT an idiot! Numbers don't agree with my brain very much, but that's gonna change, starting now! Thanks for giving me the motivation I need to help me, Remote! You're the best!" She gave a quick hug. "Tomorrow, I'm gonna go see if that new kid's gonna help me out! He wears glasses, so he's gotta be smart, right?"</p><p>Remote exchanged a puzzled glance at Bottle. "Overwhelming evidence has shown no correlation between wearing corrective lenses and intelligence. Despite this information, it would be ideal to ask for assistance. I'm sure he would gladly oblige."</p><p>"Ok! I'm going to paint first, but THEN I'm going to ask him for math help! Bye now!"<br/><br/><br/></p><p>When Bottle was not coordinating peaceful protests across town, she took to none other than the Internet to fulfill her creative juices. An avid Wattpad user and DeviantArt fiend, she would use that unbridled ambition of hers to draw vivid 3D-art and write colorful tales of an idealized world free from warfare, plague, and injustice. She always hoped to share her vision with another lucky person, remaining vigilant at the aspect of love on the horizon.</p><p>The following day at lunchtime, Bottle decided to bring the painting she composed from home to establish a good rapport with Tree: a pastel piece of dandelions flowing away in the springtime wind. She usually posts her art online but ultimately.</p><p>"Hmm... I wonder where Tree is," Bottle noted quietly, wandering around the cafeteria. "Uhh... Yo, Pie!"</p><p>"What's up, Bottle?"</p><p>"You're close with Tree, aren't you?"</p><p>"Sort of; I've only had like seven instances of conversation with him, and they were largely small talk."</p><p>"Do you know where he hangs out for lunch?"</p><p>Pie put her thumb and index finger on her chin and engaged in deep thought. "You could always check where we meet up after school. but I'd say you should check the cafeteria one more time before you do that."</p><p>"Awesome! Thanks, Pie!"</p><p>Bottle continued to scavenge the unmistakable sound of teenage conversations for the new student, humming a joyous song and admiring the quality of her art. While praising the color scheme, she became unaware of her stimuli and bumped into somebody forcefully.</p><p>"Bugger, watch where you're going, mate!"</p><p>Bottle stumbled around with her words to try and apologize to Tree - his stern demeanor was challenging to sway in times of irritation.</p><p>"Oh, uh, sorry! Are you ok, dude?"</p><p>His annoyance cooled down quickly as he realized his behavior. "Oh, it's quite alright. I think I should apologize, didn't mean to yell at you like that.</p><p>...</p><p>"Hey, you're Bottle, right? You're one of the DEATH P.A.C.T. heads, aren't you?"</p><p>"That's me! Always wanted to change the world for the better!"</p><p>Tree smiled at her enthusiasm. "I respect that immensely. I joined the organization about two or three weeks ago, actually.</p><p>"Oh yeah, I heard! It's always welcome to have more members who live cruelty-free!"</p><p>Tree shook her hand. "Glad to finally meet you, Bottle."</p><p>"Of course!"</p><p>Tree looked at the rectangular object in her hands. "What's that in your hands right there?"</p><p>Bottle blushed, somewhat nervous about revealing her painting to him. "O-oh yeah! I painted a picture of dandelions last night, and I thought it'd be neat if you got to see it! What do ya think?"</p><p>Tree's eyes lit up. "Pastel painting, right?"</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>"Excellent work! I could go on about how you used the right tools and proper brush strokes, but I'm going to omit all of that for why I think this is an amazing piece of work. I adore how the dandelion rekindles old memories and simultaneously breathes life. The fact that multiple seeds float away from the plant reminds me of the allegorical rebirth in springtime. Was that your inspiration?"</p><p>Bottle created the painting because she just likes dandelions...</p><p>"Um... sure!"</p><p>Tree chuckled. "Well, regardless of your inspirations, this piece is downright excellent. How much do you want for it? $50? $100?"</p><p>"Oh, sorry, Tree, my art isn't really for sale. I just wanted to show it to you... is that alright?"</p><p>Tree was mildly disappointed. "I get it. I'd sit and chat, but I have to go to the library. Don't want to go and procrastinate on my math homework again like I did last night, am I right?"</p><p>Bottle perked up. "Wait, Tree! I gotta ask you something!"</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>"I hate to bother you, but it would be super sweet if you could take the time out of your schedule to help me out with my math final sometime this week! Turns out I uh, have a D+ and I can't really afford to mess up again..."</p><p>The sympathy congregated in Tree's heart. "How unfortunate! I think I can help with that; I'm taking honors precalculus, so I think the material is still pretty fresh. How does tomorrow sound?"</p><p>Bottle was overjoyed. "Yay!" She gave a genuine hug as the vulnerability invaded other emotions. "You're gonna be an awesome friend, Tree; thank you so much! Anyways, I gotta eat; it's Tofu Tuesday! See you then!"</p><p>As Bottle returned to Pie and Remote's table on the opposite side of the cafeteria, Tree felt a familiar tingle surge throughout his body.</p><p>"Can't wait...~."</p><p>
<b>2 YEARS LATER</b>
</p><p>DEATH P.A.C.T. made some crucial headway in including vegetarian/vegan options for school lunches at a subsidized price. Most importantly, Tree asked Bottle to be his girlfriend freshman year of college, of which she happily agreed. She passed that math class and the next one the year later due to Tree's tutoring. Bottle's life seemed to have gone uphill from there.</p><p>The relationship going steady for a few months now, the transition was beyond smooth. Bottle adored the intimate connections with Tree, and Tree was captivated by his girlfriend's contagious positivity. The two shared an apartment together, as they went to different colleges - Tree went to Y.C.U. (Yoylecake University), while Bottle went to the local community college, thankfully, the institutions were about 20 minutes away, so distance was not troubling.</p><p>Most of all, Tree simply couldn't get enough of her physical intimacy. He regarded Bottle's cuddles as top-grade love, truly signifying a union as pure as the driven snow.</p><p>As much as Bottle was infatuated with her activist boyfriend, she wanted to tread deeper waters to feed into her insatiable desires to connect, an opportunity to tune her feelings with his, the perfect chance to better understand Tree's pure experience. She knew exactly¬†<em>what¬†</em>the destination was - the endgame was to determine¬†<em>how¬†</em>to get to that point.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>It was a brisk October evening. The onset of fall chilled the air that night, intensifying Bottle's cuddly cravings.</p><p>Bottle walked into her car, tired from a sluggish day at the college listening to milquetoast professors droning on about who knows what. She turned on some upbeat music to ease her agitation. All she could think about was listening to Tree's soothing, charming words.</p><p><em>"I do my hair toss, check my nails. Baby how you feelin' feelin GOOD as HECK,"¬†</em>Bottle sang poorly. She was always allowed to swear but thought that a dirty mouth would lead to an impure mind, so she refrained from cursing whenever she was able to.</p><p>"Wow, I forgot how effective this song is at hyping me up! Lizzo, you queen!" She exclaimed, the smile on her face returning with renewed radiance. She got to the apartment building and walked at a brisk pace, eager to set eye contact with her boyfriend once more. When Bottle opened the door, she witnessed Tree reading some Angela Davis on the couch.</p><p>He turned his head to get a peek at the individual gracing his presence, and of course, it was none other than the object of his infatuation. "Oh, Bottle, fancy seeing you here, as usual!"</p><p>"Hi Tree, get over here, sweetie!" She cried happily, embracing him warmly. Coming home to the appeasing scents of peach blossom and jasmine candles alongside Tree's minty musk put her at peak comfort.</p><p>"Haha, such a cuddle bug, so cute," Tree chuckled, kissing Bottle on the cheek. "So darling, how was your day?"</p><p>"Ugh, loooong and booooring! I already knew everything in environmental science, so I had to fight the urge to take a nap there; statistics was a mess, you get the idea..."</p><p>"Oh no, that's quite a drag!" Tree gave her a little kiss on the nose. "Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?"</p><p>The naughty thoughts began to rebound in Bottle's mind.</p><p>"Oh! Umm, I literally got nothing. I have gotta change out of these clothes, though; maybe that'll help jog my mind! Be back in a jiff!"</p><p>"Cheers," Tree retorted.</p><p>The woman closed the door, now rife with adrenaline. She sat on the bed and giggled, unable to control her unbridled horniness. At that moment, she knew exactly what she had to do to strengthen their bond.</p><p>Five minutes passed, and Tree was concerned about what took her that long to swap out a cardigan and baggy pants.¬†<em>She probably took a nap,¬†</em>he inferred, so he looked to his left and to his right. Quieter than Evil Leafy.</p><p>"Coast is clear. I guess I could squeeze this in...," he uttered before creeping into the bathroom, pulling his pants and underwear down, and grabbing the lotion. Nobody knew this about Tree, but despite his no-nonsense demeanor, he was (and still is) incredibly prone to getting turned on. Within a well-concealed folder on his phone was a voluminous assortment of naked bodies, fetishes, cocks, dildos, vaginas‚Äîall under the folder "school stuff."</p><p>Tree put his right hand on his erection, played some cunnilingus on his phone, and began to stroke the stiff organ rhythmically. In a matter of seconds, he watched his heart skip a beat at the primal display, exciting him further. The energy exchange was contagious, leading the man to desire nothing but the alluring prospect of sex.</p><p>Tree bit his lip forcefully. "Yeah, leave no area behind, get it all~," he demanded quietly, leaning closer towards the lascivious display.</p><p>Bottle snapped out of her distractions and exited the bedroom. "Hey Tree, I-, uh... where did you go?" He was nowhere in the living room, kitchen, guest bedroom, or closets, so the only room left was the bathroom. She knocked on the door with considerable force.</p><p>She heard her boyfriend gasp, abruptly taking him out of an alternate reality he put himself in. "Bottle! Bloody Mary, y-you scared me!" She let out a few laughs at the reaction.</p><p>"S-sorry, hee hee. Do you know when you're gonna come out? I have something important to tell you!"</p><p>"In a minute! Just let me flush the toilet first!"</p><p>He hastily pulled his pants up, "washed" his hands, and opened the door in hopes that Bottle wouldn't suspect anything. His girlfriend greeted him wearing a rolled-up T-shirt with the Earth on it and some black panties. All that exposed skin sent the blood straight to his dick, craving even more attention.</p><p>"Follow me!" Bottle coaxed him with her hand, and Tree followed suit.</p><p>Sitting on the bed, Tree felt like he had just drunk five cups of coffee.¬†<em>Is this real? If it is, I'm going all in.</em></p><p>"Well... you look... nice," Tree declared sheepishly, not knowing how to process the beauty that was in front of him.</p><p>"Aww, so nice to hear you say that! I just wanted to get nice and comfortable," she confessed with a subtle wink, laying down on her back. Bottle gave a signaling stare, leading Tree to lie on his side and wrap himself around her, arms resting over the waist gently.</p><p>"That's better," Bottle said quietly, letting out a content sigh. She smiled for a brief moment before turning on the other side, resting her head on Tree's shoulders with her hands on Tree's chest. "Listen, about that thingy I talked about before..."</p><p>"Nervous to spit it out? Remember, you can share anything with me. This is a safe space," he replied sternly.</p><p>"No, no... well, maybe a little bit, heh heh... ok! It's been a few months since we got together, and every day, I couldn't be more grateful for the healthy relationship we have built together! But I thought that we could try something new so we could be more in sync, maybe something you'd want to try out? I'm down for anything!"</p><p>
<em>Is this real? Am I on some hidden camera show where I hear this loud siren, then the crowd laughs and applauds as the host tells me I've been duped by my very own girlfriend? No, snap out of it Tree! You have to believe Bottle; she's the most honest, kind, and affectionate person you know!</em>
</p><p>"Something new that we could do to get closer together, huh? We could go rock climbing or hiking this weekend," Tree suggested.</p><p>Bottle looked in the opposite direction."Mmm, I was thinking something that we could do right now."</p><p>"Oh, alright. You wanna watch a movie? Maybe talk about a podcast?"</p><p>The woman shook her head. "No, silly! I mean we...um..." Before he confirmed the true scope of her actions, Bottle grabbed Tree by the arms and pressed her lips against his. The kiss was so abrupt Tree thought his mouth was caught in a headlock with hers. He stared at her incredulously, unable to grasp what just happened.</p><p>"Oh... oh my god... wow..."</p><p>Bottle smiled. "Yeah...that kind of stuff..."</p><p>The two stared at each other, unable to take their eyes off of each other's gaze. They knew exactly what they wanted from each other, but found themselves entrenched in the tension.</p><p>Tree finally spoke up.</p><p>"So, heh... should I um... if you want... I can help you get comfortable even m-more... please~..."</p><p>Bottle's cheeks grew red. "Yeah, I-I'd like that. Whatever it takes to get closer~."</p><p>Tree chuckled. "Honestly I'm quite surprised you want this, considering how you're probably the most innocent person I know."</p><p>"C'mon, I'm not innocent!" Bottle pouted.</p><p>"Is that so? Say 'shit' right now. If you can do that, I'll take it back," Tree flirted playfully.</p><p>"S-s... s-s-sh... sh-sh-shi... A.W., C'MON, REALLY? JUST DO SOMETHING TO ME YA BIG GOOF!"</p><p>Tree fell into an uncontrollable fit of laughter afterward. "Oh, alright, I'm just messing with you. Say, what exactly¬†<em>do</em>¬†you want?"</p><p>Bottle tilted her head. "What do you mean, Tree?"</p><p>"Like what arouses you? If you wanted to connect on a deeper level, I think a good place to start entails some sort of communication."</p><p>Bottle really wasn't picky. Her libido wasn't as high as Tree's, but her preferences were too much to list in one sitting; she was eager to participate in many, if not all, forms of sexual activity.</p><p>"Well, give some things a try and see if they stick. It's our own little adventure, and we're going on it together~."</p><p>"Are you sure, Bottle?"</p><p>Bottle shushed him with her finger. "Shh, shh, no think, just do!"</p><p>"Alrighty then," Tree uttered reluctantly.<br/>Tree smacked his lips onto hers, slowly moving down to her neck, where he wasted no time in giving it some love. He gave the area some wet kisses, nibbling and blowing at it in between to really stimulate those sensitive nerve endings.</p><p>Bottle squealed from the pleasure, holding back the urge to burst out in a fit of laughter. To put it simply, she was surprised that her boyfriend could make her feel so at ease.</p><p>"Oh wow... this makes me feel nice," she cooed, giggling at the inviting sensation.</p><p>Motivated by the praise, Tree moved downward and rested his hands on Bottle's milky thighs. He moistened his mouth and pulled down her panties, revealing her needy entrance. She covered her face and gasped.</p><p>"I-it's out... i-it's out, Tree~," she slurred her speech, gleaming with excitement.</p><p>Following his girlfriend's advice, he gripped her thighs and started to slowly lick her labia. He had hoped that Bottle would not catch on to the fact that he knew absolutely nothing about female anatomy other than from the porn he watched.</p><p>"Wait, c-could you move your tongue a little bit to the right?"</p><p>Tree obliged, Bottle releasing a steady flow of coarse laughter. He was baffled, annoyed at his perceived inability to please his lover.</p><p>"Why are you laughing? I'm trying my hardest here!"</p><p>"N-no, heh heh, i-it's just that, uhh... HA HA HA...¬† wow... I'm a r-really g-giggly person when it comes to this stuff. I laugh when I get turned on; is that cool or what?"</p><p>"Really? That's so interesting," Tree smiled, his erection growing ever so slightly. The reassurance gave the man a large confidence boost. "Yeah I guess it is, heh heh... p-please keep going though," Bottle replied frantically.</p><p>Tree continued with the cunnilingus, making sure to alternate his technique with a healthy mix of circles and lines. He'd oscillate between bouts of fast and slow licks to tease her further; he wanted to keep her guessing for the entire session.</p><p>Just when Bottle began to understand his intentions, he removed his tongue from her nether regions and stuck two of his sinewy fingers inside of her, his other hand crawling towards her plump ass and giving it a gentle tap. She was enamored with Tree's pursuit to please. "Ooh, this is s-so fun! Don't stop, please!" Bottle hollered. "I don't plan to," he responded with a mischievous grin. The man watched in delight as he slowly watched his girlfriend succumb to the pleasure - each and every stroke, smack, and lick led her to become putty in his hands, squirming and squealing with glee as the connections she sought after were all but certain to blossom.¬†</p><p>Before he knew it, Bottle's squirming looked more like mild convulsions as her first orgasm approached faster than a final exam date. Her wide smile quivered as she felt the lustful urges overwhelm her entire body.¬†</p><p>"T-Tree, baby... y-you're so good at this! Y-you really know how to show a girl a good time!" Bottle replied happily, giving him a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>Tree couldn't help but stammer at such kind words. "Didn't expect that to work at all, but I'm flattered, truly," he replied, grazing her cheek with his hand."</p><p>Bottle shoved some of her fingers lustfully inside. "So I guess that means you're done?" Bottle asked casually. With that newfound conviction of his, Tree pulled her hand out of her pussy and gave her a passionate kiss without warning. He then grabbed Bottle's wrist and sucked her fingers dry, curious to get a taste of the wetness that percolated on the bedsheets.¬†</p><p>Tree donned a cheeky smile. "I'd be beyond clueless to fathom that we'd be done after I fingered you only once~," he flirted playfully. "I plan to explore every inch of your sexiness in more ways than one."</p><p>Bottle giggled. "Ooh, goody! You HAVE to give me a preview!"</p><p>Tree chuckled. "Well, that would be spoiling the fun now, wouldn't it? I don't want to ruin the surprise...</p><p>"Aw, come on! Please! What are you gonna do to me! I'm dying to know!" Bottle began to masturbate in anticipation."¬†<em>God, Bottle is so damn hot</em>, Tree thought to himself, resisting the urge to succumb to her cuteness. "Nope, a gentleman never screws and tells, heh heh..."</p><p>"Dang it..."</p><p>"I'm going to take this off first," Tree remarked quietly, reaching for the hem of Bottle's shirt. Bottle giggled as Tree ordered her to raise her arms. Tree couldn't help but stare in awe, drooling over her flat stomach and bare breasts glistening in the dim light.</p><p>"I was wondering when you were gonna do that," Bottle chuckled. "Y'know, I feel like you've been pretty¬†<em>dressed</em>¬†lately. After all, I'm the one who's completely naked here! Get over here, you..." With a warm smile, Tree removed his top while she unzipped his jeans, uncovering a thick cock. His twitching six-and-a-half-inch member, blessed with girth and veins, was warm to the touch. Eager for some pampering, the organ was desperate for stimulation.</p><p>Tree wasn't just well endowed - he was particularly in shape. Eating primarily fruits and vegetables allowed him to maintain a slender physique, and the running club he was vice president in back in high school garnered an impressive accumulation of muscle. "I never get tired of this," Bottle cooed warmly, wasting no time to touch his toned figure.</p><p>She stared at his exposed penis. "Can I do something real quick?"</p><p>Realizing her intentions, Tree played along. "Yeah, me."¬†</p><p>Bottle rolled her eyes. "Shut up, ya big dork, and lemme have fun with your thing already!" She got on her knees and grabbed his member, giving Tree the privilege of some breathing room before the main event.</p><p>"Are ya ready, sweetie?" With a quick nod, Bottle started to get to work, and boy was her technique grade-A quality. Wrapping her other hand around his member, she started by grabbing his penis delicately, wrapping her fingers around the shaft. She made sure to keep her pinky finger closest to his balls while her index finger was closest to the top of his penis. She slowly stroked his cock up and down like normal, but while she massaged his erect member, Bottle rubbed her thumb over and back on the head of his penis, allowing her to perform the standard up and down hand job technique while her thumb pleasured the tip.</p><p>Tree barely contained his moans for his lover, erring close to the side of primitive cave-grunting.¬†</p><p>Bottle was pleased with the reciprocation. "Like it, huh? Glad to hear it!"</p><p>The horny woman decided to perform another technique, one she liked to call "The Gentle Claw." First, she made her fingers into a sort of claw - just like the ones you'd find in those games in bowling alleys and arcades where you try to position the claw and pick up a prize. This time she kept her fingertips together, lowering her hand onto Tree's head, then allowed her fingertips to spread out over the head of his penis as she lowered her hand further down his cock.¬†</p><p>The varying amounts of pressure almost put Tree in a quiet frenzy, unable to control his primal urges.¬†</p><p>"Oh, f-fuck, h-holy shit, yes... YES PLEASE!" Tree shouted.</p><p>Bottle was slightly alarmed with the language, but if her little present to Tree meant that she wielded power over his composure, that was more than enough for her to let it slide and move on.¬†</p><p>She continued to go through with alternations of both techniques, varying the pressure and warmth of her hands by applying some of her spit to the mix as a (poor) substitute for lubrication. Tree was nearing climax, but he would be damned to miss another opportunity as intimate as this, so he resisted.¬†</p><p>"Bottle, move your hands," Tree insisted.¬†</p><p>"Aw, why'd we stop? I thought we'd be getting to the good part,¬†<em>wink wink</em>!"¬†</p><p>Tree chuckled. "We will, but... not right this second. I think it's about time we quit the appetizers and start work on the entree~..."</p><p>Bottle looked around, bewildered by his remark. "But I don't see any food here..."</p><p>"Oh haha, I meant like..." He formed the "okay" symbol in his left hand and began taking his right index finger into and out of the hole. Bottle started to giggle.</p><p>"Ah.¬†<em>Ohhhhhhh</em>, you meant...that... oh my gosh, yes! I'm so ready!~." She instinctively let her hand dive down into her vagina once again.</p><p>Before Tree could continue, he could not in good conscience "dive in" without taking the proper precautions. "Bottle, wait. I need to get protection. I know I have condoms somewhere in my backpack..."¬†</p><p>She pulled his hand away. "But Tree, it doesn't feel as good if you put a condom on, right?"¬†</p><p>Tree grew somewhat annoyed by that remark. "Well, what would you rather have: a guy that's decent enough to protect you against gonorrhea or a guy that doesn't care about getting a 20-year-old who's in college pregnant?"</p><p>Bottle's smile quickly vanished. "Well, neither... I trusted you either way."</p><p>Her boyfriend's passive-aggressiveness cooled down. "Y-you did?"</p><p>"I mean, I did! You're so smart, funny, and logical that I thought you'd know how to handle you and me in these situations. I know you'll be careful! Now please, stick it in me! Oh, I'm so excited!"</p><p>Tree wasn't too keen on completely disregarding proper contraception, but he had to cooperate to foster a good connection.¬†</p><p>"Oh, alright. But PLEASE take a pregnancy test ASAP!"</p><p>"I don't think I n---"</p><p>"<b>Take the test</b>," Tree commanded sternly.¬†</p><p>"Whatever you say, tee hee!"¬†<em>How does Bottle change her mood so quickly?</em>¬†</p><p>Bottle laid down on her back, and Tree followed on top of her, standing right beside the edge of the bed. The two were rife with lust and unbridled passion, finally able to fulfill their need for the ultimate form of connection there is. He lined up the tip of his penis with her entrance, lightly grazing the edges of her wet folds with his thumb.</p><p>"H-here I go..." Tree slowly pushed down into Bottle, the impact shaking the bedsprings with impressive force. He thrusted fast, but resisted just a little while longer to make sure her girlfriend was accommodated to his size. In the meantime, his goal was to slow down, focusing on his breath and syncing his exhales with his partner's. This allowed him to savor the sexual sensations he was experiencing as a unit.¬†</p><p>Bottle was laughing nonstop, covering her mouth to try and muffle that infectious sound of hers.</p><p>As a mode of experimentation, Tree lowered his chest onto hers so he could exhale into her mouth while they inhale. Not only was this titillating to experience, but these deeper breaths increased blood flow and circulation to the pelvic area, thereby increasing the pleasure and stamina factors immensely.¬†</p><p>"Ok, I think you can go faster now~..."</p><p>Instead of going faster, Tree thought the best mode of action was to go harder. To achieve that extra degree of deeper penetration, he placed a pillow beneath Bottle's lower back to prop up her pelvis. Tilting her pelvis upward forced him to thrust downward and thus more deeply into her sopping pussy. The pleasure led Bottle to wrap her soft, silky legs around Tree's waist, opening up her entrance wider.¬†</p><p>"Mmm, you feel s-so good, Tree... you're go-ing like a pro, ungh... whatever you do, don't stop~."</p><p>"Bottle... you make me feel good... I never want this moment to end... I never want¬†<em>us</em>¬†to end~," Tree kissed her on the neck.¬†</p><p>"T-Tree, o-o-oh... I l-love you s-so much..."</p><p>"I l-love you too, sweetie...¬†</p><p>Eager for some more stimulation, Bottle had other ideas to keep the sexual energy driving forward.</p><p>"Touch me, Tree... p-please!"</p><p>Despite being completely naked, Tree still took his time teasing Bottle's perfect tits. He spent some time tracing her collarbone with your finger, then kissing along it. He touched and kissed along the sides of the breasts, without going straight for the nipple just yet. He then very gently traced his tongue along this sensitive curve, starting at the outer edge yet again and slowly working his way around to the middle of her chest. The subtle hand movements slowly evolved into light stroking, caressing the mounds with the back of his hand as if they were his own children.</p><p>"Hmmmm~... my breasts... y-you made them so t-tender~," Bottle slurred," drooling over Tree's delicate movements.</p><p>He repeated this pattern for another minute or so, but had little patience left; he was about to blow any minute. "Get ready, my love... I'm gonna... o-oh my god I'm gonna cum... B-B-Bottle, squish your tits... take those tits of yours and jam them together, I'm gonna cum in them~..."</p><p>She obliged, and in a matter of seconds, a tidal wave of pressure collided with an earthquake of sexual tension as hot, gooey semen shooted out of Tree's warm cock. The dirty spunk on Bottle's chest shot fast, the sensation causing her to burst in an uncontrollable episode of laughter.¬†</p><p>"WHOA! HA HA HA! Wow, that shot far!"</p><p>Tree continued to jerk himself off as he tried his very hardest to release every little glob of cum he could onto Bottle's perfect tits. When the last drop of cum dripped in between them, she unsquished her breasts to reveal Tree's handiwork.</p><p>"That was the best sex I ever had! You had me in tune with your moves from the very beginning! I loved it when you played with my breasts; I don't know how you do it! I-it felt so super duper ultra mega good..."</p><p>Tree pulled out and collapsed onto the bed, fatigued from such a demanding session.</p><p>"I'm glad I could satisfy."</p><p>"Yeah, amazing... and you made such a mess! I'm glad I could make you so happy!" Bottle exclaimed.</p><p>Tree accepted the compliment with a tender kiss on the cheek. "You are so god damn beautiful, you know that?"</p><p>

<p>Don't worry, I'm not dead or stopping the production of requests to those who asked for a chapter - I'm just making sure I adapt to a brand new semester. The first day of classes is tomorrow and it always takes a while to get back into the swing of things after a month of doing nothing but playing video games.</p><p>I am not going to stop writing; that would be unfair to those who have waited for weeks and sometimes months for a request. It's been so long some of them have probably forgotten they requested something, and I apologize for them being victims of my lack of inspiration and/or motivation in the past month.</p><p>This collection of stories you're probably too embarrassed to admit you like (myself included) is reaching 10,000 reads, and I am so thankful for all the kind support and interaction I've received since I started writing last summer. I read every single comment that comes my way; to those who have requested or replied, at the end of the day, that's why I still write this stuff.</p><p>To make sure I have a finite quantity of stories to work with for the spring semester and to cut the sappy shit short,¬†<b>I AM STILL TAKING REQUESTS, BUT ONLY UNTIL FEBRUARY 1 AT 11:59 PM.

Expect that to come out by the first few days of February at the latest. I also plan to write some BFDI smut myself, so stay tuned for that.</p><p>Most people I've come across have been great, but there have been instances, both with me and other writers, where requesters have relentlessly asked us when their requests will be done.

<div class="userstuff">
<p>I apologize that it took so long to get this request done - gotta be almost five months.</p><p>To be honest, this ship doesn't really do it for me as much as others (there are better lesbian ships IMO), but I totally understand why some people ship this. Enjoy!</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>The sky took on a purplish hue as nymphs and shepherds moved around her. A Komodo dragon wished her a happy birthday while doing the woah. Abraham Lincoln told her to drink warm milk on Fridays. Cabby felt herself lose balance under the excruciating weirdness of it all, unsure of what to accomplish, unfamiliar with how to begin interpreting what was going on. Suddenly, she felt a strong tremor creep up from beneath her.</p><p>Within seconds, the entrance to a frightening cave surfaced above the trembling earth below her feet. The mysterious entrance, darker than a black hole, clouded the woman's thoughts with uncertainty.</p><p>"Hmm... according to my calculated risk assessment, there is a 1 in 8,008,135 chance of serious death, the most prominent causes including being ingested by killer bears, getting crushed by rolling boulders, being stabbed by stalactites, and hornets..."</p><p>Due to all four of those being rare occurrences, she ventured onward into the great unknown. Just barely fitting under the cave's small entrance intensified Cabby's uneasy attitude, unable to stop herself from breathing heavily.</p><p>Each step she took echoed along the darkened path. "W-wow... I c-can't get an indication of any parameters of any kind! Topographic analysis offline, barometric pressure, weather, radar, sonar... am I anywhere?"</p><p>Suddenly, a loud crash from above stopped the woman in her tracks. Cabby ducked for cover, trying her hardest to defend herself for what she believed were her final moments... until none of that happened. There was a light at the end of the tunnel. Walking through it led her towards a tropical beach with lush wildlife, warm sand, and perfectly blue water.</p><p>"Charming, isn't it~?"</p><p>The disembodied voice giggled happily, beckoning Cabby to come closer. She turned to the left quickly, and what she witnessed was the sweetest sight to behold.</p><p>She came across her subordinate Clover lying on her side atop a beach towel, one hand on her head, the other on her hip. A green bikini covered her plump ass and bountiful breasts, the perfect color to complement her ample cleavage. Coaxing her with her finger, Cabby approached the vixen slowly, flustered from her passion.</p><p>"Hey, hey... it's okay... I won't bite... But I do kiss~..."</p><p>She gave Cabby a soft smooch on the lips, placing her warm palms onto hers. The intimacy filled her with glee, the intoxicating warmth of Clover's breath clouding her judgment. The prospect of life-threatening danger vanished as the siren song of her playful laughter melted her heart faster than ice cream on a hot summer day.</p><p>"Y-you're so...b-beautiful..."</p><p>Clover giggled, reaching for her back to undo her bra strap. She lathered herself in massage oil, lubricating her soft skin. She waltzed on over to Cabby, whose fingers were hovering over her now exposed genitalia.</p><p>"I've been waiting for this my entire life," Clover announced, pulling down her bikini bottom. She pinned Cabby down to the ground and sat atop her, grinding against her entrance with vigor.</p><p>Before anything else could happen further, Cabby found herself under the covers. She felt a familiar fluid accumulating under the bedsheets.</p><p>"It was all a dream?!? Ughh, and now my comforter's sticky! Wait, why was I dreaming of Clover of all people? More importantly, why did I have an erotic fantasy with a woman? Having overly amorous feelings for a coworker hinders workplace productivity and is against protocol! I've never experienced such desires until this very moment - what am I going to do?!?"</p><p>She caught a glimpse of the clock - it read 7:00.</p><p>"Hmm... it appears that I must deal with this predicament later, for I have more important business to attend to."</p><p>Cabby was the regional manager of Nickle Co., a trading firm where she climbed up the corporate ladder for five years straight. Her team may not appreciate her as a person for the most part, but they always recognized her dedication to the job at hand. Her superior leadership, enthralling motivation, and unrivaled intelligence made her a force to be reckoned with, compelling the hearts and minds of even the most embittered executives.</p><p>After showering and getting dressed in her work attire, she had a quick breakfast and headed into her car, ready for another productive day.<br/><br/><br/></p><p>She arrived at the building with that managerial smile on her face - the one that reeks of staged positivity. She began her daily shpiel as soon as everyone on her team showed up.</p><p>"Alright, team, we got a busy day ahead of us, but that doesn't mean we can't give it our absolute best! Some of us yesterday failed to reach our reporting quotas. I'm not angry, but if those people do not change something to pick up the pace, corporate is going to be very unhappy, and by unhappy with you, I mean unhappy with me, and I think it's in our interest to cooperate, correct?"</p><p>Groggy from a previous day of monotonous desk work, Cabby's team was too tired to entirely give vocal agreement, so they sat lazily in their chairs and nodded. Some said nothing. Some groaned.</p><p>"Sorry, what was that? I'm unsure about compliance unless you express it verbally!" She uttered in a singsong voice.</p><p>The crew reluctantly replied with a louder response, which satisfied the supervisor. "That's what I like to hear! I know I'm ready to give it 110%, so let's begin while we're ahead. Anyway, I looked into the analytics for next quarter, and I think that if we leverage our goodwill with millennials, that would exponentially increase sales. If you look at this pie chart that I carefully constructed, you can see deficits for that age group and for Gen Z, which is in purple and brown..."</p><p>Cabby continued to ramble about logistics, which impacted little in boosting worker morale. To them, "giving it 110%" meant working thirteen-hour days for the next week for arbitrary reasons. The tangled mess of lifeless metaphors and derivative motivational cliches seemed to leave Clover unaffected, that infectious smile of hers refusing to leave.</p><p>There was something different about Clover that made it impossible for the girlboss¬†<em>(I'm sorry)¬†</em>to ignore. Was it her unconditional support that softened her stance? Was it her charisma with her coworkers? Or maybe it was something else...</p><p>"Alright, I have nothing else to disclose, so let's reach for the stars! And remember, teamwork makes the dream work!"<br/><br/><br/></p><p>Four hours into the current workday, Cabby reviewed her crew's performance quickly because she had to meet with the managers of the other departments in the next half-hour. Business picked up slightly compared to the previous day, but not as much as she'd like. Despite this, the manager stayed optimistic.</p><p>
<em>The day is half done. Besides, it's almost break time, and I have on file that workplace productivity increases threefold after a good meal</em>
<em>...</em>
</p><p>She had to take a long-anticipated trip to the bathroom. When she went to the sink to wash her hands, she saw none other than Clover doing the same.</p><p>"Hello, Ms. Cabby! Aren't you having the best day?"</p><p>"Oh, good afternoon, Clover! Everything's hunky-dory on my end," she responded.</p><p>"That's great, 'cause I think everyone does better if their main focus is to smile!" She smiled and winked, exposing her dimples in the process.¬†</p><p>Cabby was pleasantly taken aback by such a gesture, but maintaining professionalism was crucial. "Uh, certainly. Hey, can I talk to you real quick? There's something that I need to discuss with you, preferably in private," Cabby said somewhat sternly.</p><p>Clover's smile was exchanged for a look of concern, somewhat fearful of the implications.</p><p>"Uh... of course!"</p><p>Cabby smiled. "I appreciate it! If you could follow me," she said temperately.</p><p>Walking within the labyrinth of cubicles, water coolers, and pictures of spouses elicited strong feelings of dismay from the girl in the green pantsuit. How was she going to make Cabby smile if things went south? How would she make herself smile? To Clover, good vibes run all, and this impromptu meeting hindered that mindset. Sitting in Cabby's office was a sleek black mahogany desk complete with a Dell computer and nameplate, an array of plaques and diplomas, and a giant framed "Hang In There" poster with a smiling Grumpy Cat.¬†</p><p>"Now, Clover, before I discuss the reasoning behind this brief interruption from your responsibilities, I take pride in my convictions regarding your capabilities. I admire your attitude immensely, and I vehemently believe that quality alone makes you an asset."</p><p>Clover, somewhat unable to decipher those long-winded comments, nodded to be polite.¬†</p><p>"Oh neat, buh bye!" she sang, humming a familiar tune.</p><p>"I uh... wasn't finished. You see, you've performed quite well so far this quarter, but over the past two weeks, it seems as if your productivity is on a rapid decline...¬† you haven't made a single sale from any of our clients within the past two weeks, you haven't logged the accounts payable nor the accounts receivable. You skipped a meeting without notifying me! Now work with me," Cabby declared, clasping her hands. "Is there anything extenuating going on that you believe a detriment to your executive function?"</p><p>Clover laid her head on her fist. "Ummmmmm.... uhhhhh...."</p><p>"Anything at all that I should know about?" Cabby questioned with sincerity. "If it's confidential, I don't mind taking you to HR."</p><p>She should've known her boss would come across her inattention as of late. Usually, everything comes up roses for the bubbly lady, but her luck took an unsuspecting turn ever since the incident occurred. Last month, she bought a limited edition sex toy - one of the best ones on the market. Ever since, she began experiencing powerful orgasms, ones that made Clover grunt like a Viking, ones that spurted rapid gushes of sweet, savory sex that lulled her to sleep. The device satisfied her urges in a way that improved her productivity and attentiveness until she got hooked. The dildo was¬†<em>too¬†</em>good at its job, decimating away at her concentration. A few weeks later, she lost the dildo but failed to remember its last whereabouts, which put the poor woman in a complicated web of sex withdrawal.</p><p>Clover's eyes darted frantically as she scrambled to find a good lie to tell her boss; however, the words were merely a series of unintelligible stammers.</p><p>Cabby sighed. "If you won't tell me, I understand. I'll clear you for the next hour so you can take the time to talk to Tea Kettle over at HR. Whatever you're going through, I know she's qualified to guide you through whatever's plaguing you."</p><p>"N-no no, it's okay," Clover protested, blushing from the shame.</p><p>"Clover, I insist; it is imperative that you seek guidance! We're a team, and every member relies on one another to get the job done! Without a collective effort, the numbers take a hit, here I'll show you."</p><p>Just as she was about to pull up some analytics that prove her point, what came up instead was a titillating porn video of two women engaging in an intense degradation session. The horror set in on Cabby's face almost instantly, her volatile mind ricocheting into all sorts of dramatic scenarios.¬†</p><p>"<em>oh no...¬†</em>Heh-heh... t-that was uh... a v-virus, I-I think..."</p><p>Clover took notice of her boss fully out of character, squirming in her chair with lust as her racy fantasies dominated her judgment. She could feel her vagina dampening by the second. And this was her only chance - she could've forgotten about the incident and returned to her cubicle... or she could have the hottest sex of her life and get paid while doing it...¬†</p><p>"A-anyways Clover, y-you're f-free to go now... I apologize for such unprofessional behavior, and I fully expect you to report me to the proper disciplinary bodies so I can be properly punished."</p><p>Clover's control vanished. It was either now or never. Does she dare fly too close to the sun or quit before she lands herself in hot water?</p><p>¬†</p><p>¬†</p><p>"I mean... I hate to see you so heartbroken. And I know¬†<b>EXACTLY</b>¬†what to do that would cheer you up, hee hee hee! But before I tell you what my plan is, I have a couple questions for you, Ms. Cabby."</p><p>Cabby's head spiraled into a territory she hadn't explored in about ten years. The butterflies in her stomach, sweaty palms, and quivering lips were symptoms for the sickest disease known to humankind:¬†<b>arousal</b>.¬†</p><p>Cabby coughed, sweating nervously. "S-sure. H-happy to l-learn m-more."</p><p>Clover unbuttoned the top button on her top and strutted toward Cabby's desk, resting her hands firmly on the furnished wood.¬†</p><p>"What would you do if I want to lick your clit from bottom to top? If I just, you know~," she sighed wistfully, "swirl my tongue around your vagina until I feel it throb? What would you do if I rubbed you against my wet pussy until neither of us can stand it?"</p><p>Cabby gulped, tugging at her collar. "O-oh my g-goodness... a-anything e-else?"</p><p>Clover sat on the edge of the desk, making sure her boss would feel her balmy breath climb into her nostrils.¬†</p><p>"Well," she said playfully, twiddling her finger onto Cabby's chest. "How would you feel if I bend you over like a paperclip and just eat you out from behind, losing your mind as I squirm these magic fingers of mine inside of you?"</p><p>Cabby fanned herself with her hand. "I-is it bad that I-I'm t-turned on at w-work?"</p><p>"I bet you'd lose your mind if I just went faster and faster, just until you're on the brink of cumming. Then I'd stop, just as you beg and scream for more."</p><p>"NO! DON'T STOP!" Cabby screamed, reflexively covering her hands with her mouth. Blushing a deep shade of red, she cleared her throat. "W-well, I don't want that at all. Y-you've worked here for two years and I've never seen this side of you, even when we all went to that Christmas party at Goiky Industries and had to do HR training the next day."</p><p>Clover nodded her head. "My job's on the line, Ms. Cabby. I gotta do what I gotta do."</p><p>Cabby almost shrieked in protest, but closed her mouth, the chasms of such a mishap too great to truly come back from. "Very well."</p><p>"Wait, you do want this, right?"</p><p>Cabby nodded.</p><p>"Okey-dokey then," Clover said in that sing-song voice, winking and sticking her tongue out. She decided it would be naughty to put on a little show for her boss - anything that would save her from being let go. She put on some crooner songs by Michael Buble and Sam Smith before slowly unbuttoning her frilly green jacket to the beat of the song. Before Cabby could comment, she was sidetracked by the sight of Clover's supple skin being complimented by the fluorescent lighting. She unzipped and pulled down her dress pants, revealing an unequivocally sexy green push-up bra and panties, both with tiny bows that added cuteness to the mix.</p><p>"I think it'd be pretty sweet if I took control, wouldn't you agree?" Clover said sweetly.</p><p>Cabby nodded once more, her mind in a trance. Her mind failed to properly catch up to reality; Clover took notice of her unusual aloofness and let out a cheeky giggle.</p><p>Clover grabbed her boss's shirtand carefully, stripping her out of that stuffy work attire. "Showing off some skin is good for you every now it then - it can air out those puffy boobs of yours quite nicely~." To make the situation even more interesting, Clover directed Cabby to lie down on her stomach to prepare each other for a soothing back massage. To ensure full quality and satisfaction, she kneeled down beside her and undid her gray bra halfway, resting her hands on her shoulder blades.¬†</p><p>Clover rested her hands on Cabby's shoulder blades, devoting much attention to her upper body first. It was important that she maintained contact with her skin the entire time to keep her relaxed and comfortable. The subordinate sunk her colorful nails into Cabby's sensitive spine, making her giggle and squirm around the floor. "Hold still, my darling," she insisted.</p><p>She then placed her hands at the top of her boss's puffy ass, fanning them up and out. Clover attempted to sync those fingers with her body by letting her butt's natural round shape. The treatment released a great deal of tension from her lower back.</p><p>"Mmm, Clover... I c-can feel my troubles w-wither away in your hands~."</p><p>Clover smiled. She continued to outwardly rub the sides and back up around the fleshy mounds in a circular motion, making sure to pull the edges of her butt up on the sides while kneading the fleshy areas on top. To Clover, the massage was nothing less of making cookies at Christmastime. The worker positioned herself further down Cabby's legs for better access. Clover pressed the palm of your hand into the back of her lower-thigh, just nearing her knee. Pushing upward, that savory skin went all the way into the meat of the buttocks.</p><p>"My w-word, Clover... s-so s-satisfying... k-keep it u-up down there~..."</p><p>Clover made small, circular motions to the pressure points around the triangle at the base of Cabby's lower back. She made continuous movement throughout the massage. Any pauses¬† made the subordinate believe they would startle her or make her wonder what's next, which isn't very relaxing.</p><p>Clover moved away from the butt worship and gestured at Cabby to switch sides. She couldn't help but marvel at the sculpture that was her boss's body. It was a real crime that so much juicy curves were obstructed by the chafing shackles of a pantsuit.</p><p>"Deep breaths, Ms. Cabby."</p><p>She obliged, smiling at the way her stomach rose and fell with every breath. In a matter of a few seconds, Cabby jolted at the sensation of her employee taking the reins, squishing her double D's together, flicking her nipples, pressing her stomach, before going down to the main event.¬†</p><p>Cabby instinctively opened her legs and reveled in her handiwork.¬†Clover shaped her hand into a cup-like shape and holding it over her wet vagina, gently moving in a circular motion and flattening her hand against the opening. She circled the clitoris in clockwise and anticlockwise directions, varying between smaller and larger circles all the while alternating the pressure from her index finger. Clover then sat in a lotus position, gently sitting on Cabby's thighs and wrapping your legs around them, with your ankles crossed. The two stared into each other's eyes and breathed deeply in unison.</p><p>"You look so hot in this position, Clover. You can go all in now~..."</p><p>"Right back at you, Ms. Cabby~."</p><p>Clover laid down on her stomach, grabbed Cabby's fluffy thighs to put her in place, and began to go to work on the sensitive bud.¬† Her tongue danced slowly around the clit, sometimes lightly grazing it to start building sensation. Clover's personable personality allowed for simple readjustment of her technique, instead licking her pussy up and down, side to side, the first four letters of the alphabet, even. Cabby shuddered in delight, shivering from the tactile sensations. Cabby's hoarse moaning made Clover's job a lot harder; it required immense discipline and self-restraint to not masturbate herself.</p><p>Clover made sure to stay consistent, sometimes spicing it up with a figure-8 motion around her clit.¬†</p><p>"Uhnngh, yes please, yes please! Gimme more, gimme more! Really go for it! Teamwork makes the dream work!~" She moaned so loud it sounded like whale calls. Thankfully, the maxi-glass and tinted windows installed in her office prevented any employees from catching a glimpse of such a work of art.¬†</p><p>Clover made sure to really go for it this time, spreading Cabby's labia apart while penetrating her needy vagina with her sappy tongue. With a free hand, the subordinate reached up and grabbed her breast, sometimes rubbing her nipple as she pleasured her simultaneously.</p><p>"Oh my god... Clover... I'm gonna c-cum any second now... D-don't hold back, you g-goddess~..."</p><p>Clover returned to fingering Cabby. In a matter of a few seconds, Cabby squirted a mess onto her left hand; viscous streams of vaginal fluid caked her sweaty skin and the carpet. The substance gushed out of her pussy quickly, Clover making sure to suck on that sweet sap like the sweetest lollipop in the candy store.¬†</p><p>Cabby's thighs, entrance, and panty line were caked in her own mess. The aftermath of the orgasm made Cabby incredibly drowsy; a goofy smile accompanied delayed moans. Bouts of incomprehensible, slurred speech soon followed. Clover took the fluid and slowly spread it around her body, taking the time to dip her finger into her pussy every now and then to lick up the remains.¬†</p><p>"Ooh... my m-my... t-tfhank ye, Clo... Grover... Glover...? That was s-s-uper duper!" She laughed uncontrollably, her best judgment temporarily impaired.</p><p>"Yeah, that was super fun! Now Ms. Cabby, am I going to be fired¬†<em>now</em>?"</p><p>Cabby shook her head. "Falbsolutely not, D-Dover... you get the job as mayor!"</p><p>Cabby giggled and groped her breasts once more. "I'm going to take that as a yes."</p><p>¬†</p><p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Yeah, that's right, I'm back, and for real this time! The semester's over, so I'll have more time to write some ideas. Expect a mix of requests and my stuff this time around. Enjoy!<br/><br/><br/></p><p>The loud guitars and distortion are blaring into your eardrums. Pounding beats shake your heart. Bone-chilling vocals petrify concerning moms like an atomic bomb. Very little in this world excited Microphone, a 22-year-old laid-back woman quick with the quips, but the thrill of the six-string never failed to offer her the conviction to continue living life. Her masculine interests made her the object of ridicule from preppy girls and harassment from clueless guys, but none of those unpleasantries could ever sway her from the powerful melodies of rock 'n'roll.</p><p>Microphone's dad was part of the 1980s thrash metal band¬†<em>Konviktion</em>, a moderately successful group with modest bouts of fame here and there. The acclaim vanished instantly as the grunge movement of the 1990s wiped them into obscurity. When she was little, her mom separated from her dad; the incessant desire for comeback tours and albums destroyed their relationship. His rock-and-roll fantasies shielded him from his responsibilities as a father, which led the couple to disband.</p><p>The separation made Microphone's mother resentful of rock music of any kind. When she made enough money to buy a guitar and amp, she had to play in the attic or risk a week of being grounded. When she was 13, a search party found the girl missing in a nearby forest, which changed her mother's outlook on her hopes and dreams.</p><p>High school came around, and a group of three boys approached her and asked her to be part of a real live band. Her mother wasn't too keen on the idea, but recollecting her absence always led her to think otherwise. By the time she graduated high school, she had decided to forgo college and start hitting the road with them instantly.</p><p>Nickel was the loudmouth- the sarcastic bassist fed up with just about everything. He rarely received positive feedback from fans back at their high school, which further embittered his cold soul. He always tries to prove his worth to his bandmates due to his role in the band.</p><p>Baseball was the cool, calm, and collected drummer. He was stuck doing the managerial work, which didn't bother him much as it catered to his desire for structure. Often the only band member to practice, he chastises the others to get their act together time and time again.</p><p>Knife was the heartthrob of his high school - the tough, good-looking, arrogant lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the band. Often credited as the self-proclaimed face of the band, he always made sure his raspy voice was in mint condition for the hotties in the crowd, attempts that often backfired.</p><p>And finally, you had Microphone, the determined, dedicated lead guitarist and backup singer that always had to prove herself because of her gender. She was the band member that Baseball admired the most, and even Nickel and Knife didn't have much ammo against her. Her goal-driven, stoic attitude often led the band to take risks financially and musically.</p><p>Their rock ensemble¬†<em>Sour Cream,¬†</em>based on a catchphrase from an old friend, received lots of attention in recent years, making them local favorites. Talent scouts were in the audience at one of the school's enormous talent shows, which led them to win their first big break.</p><p>The quartet was on their way to their first long-distance gig, an exciting yet nerve-wracking event for the band as they began to brace themselves for the largest performance they've had yet. The gig was tomorrow night, so they had plenty of time to get situated.</p><p>"I wonder what the groupies here look like," Knife commented, talking to Baseball as a douchey smile adorned his face. He was reading a book, trying his hardest to drown out the predatory comments.</p><p>"I don't think a bunch of Starbucks-drinking Tiktok preppies count as much to write home about," Mic added, crossing her arms. "I bet you all the money in my rainy day fund that they have a collective IQ of 15." She couldn't help but cackle.</p><p>"Oh yeah, we should all listen to Mic's words of wisdom... after all, she is the expert on relationships after. Tell me how your last relationship went again?" Nickel smiled devilishly, his iconic sarcasm piercing her ears.</p><p>Mic socked Nickel in the arm. "Can it, shit-for-brains. Soap was just... focused on other things alright?"</p><p>She frowned, still a little bitter from the events that transpired months ago. She met a girl that she thought she really connected with but ended up cheating on Yin-Yang, the conjoined twins down the street. The neat freak broke the rocker's heart, souring her stance on relationships as a whole, especially with girlbosses like her.</p><p>"Look, whatever man, I don't give a shit enough to really invest my energy in this anymore. All I'm gonna say is that she always seemed a little... fishy to me," she crossed her arms indignantly, looking out at the window to avoid making eye contact with him.</p><p>Usually Baseball likes to drive on long trips, but the rest of the band insisted otherwise, as he reminded the three of his ridiculous rules every other hour. "Oh, Knife, make sure to take the exit in about a mile and a half," Baseball reminded him nicely.</p><p>"Relax, boss... the GPS here'll help us stay afloat," the vocalist replied, as he patted his phone lightly. He rolled his eyes with an annoying smirk.</p><p>"That may be true, but are you sure you'll stay afloat?" Baseball retorted. "The GPS was on for the Battle of the Bands last month, and we were almost late because you missed a turn. I'm doing this for your own good, trust me," Baseball exclaimed.</p><p>Knife scoffed in annoyance, his eyes still locked on the road. "Whatever man, I don't have to take shit from a dude that wore a sweater vest to a performance. How much longer, fuckface?"</p><p>Baseball could've roasted him harder than a raw chicken at a five-star restaurant, but decided to be the bigger person and turn the other cheek. "About 20 minutes. The fastest route that would save us six minutes on time is a toll road, and we're ahead of schedule anyway, so why not save five dollars?" The drummer went on about the value of budgeting, his preaching annoying Nickel immensely.</p><p>As time passed, the band eventually ended up at a three-star hotel. They couldn't exactly afford first-class amenities just yet - the group was a long way ago from achieving Foo Fighters-level fame.</p><p>After they parked their van, Baseball walked up to the front desk to the check-in line. The three waited for a few minutes for the drummer until he returned with two small cards.</p><p>"Alrighty, these are our room keys, rooms 412 and 413. Mic and I have room 412, and Baseball and Nickel have room 413. For the love of God, Knife, please try not to lose your key this time," he scoffed urgently.</p><p>Knife and Nickel protested immediately. "Aw, why do I have to stay with him? He's the literal worst!" They simultaneously groaned. If there's one thing Baseball hated more than Knife's self-righteousness, it was his constant bickering with Nickel.</p><p>Baseball exchanged a fake laugh quickly followed by a menacing look. "Because Mic and I are the competent ones and I don't wanna be stuck with the dipshits. End of discussion."</p><p>Nickel wanted to argue more, but he eventually came to his senses that he wasn't going to sway his decision no matter how hard of a case he made against him. He crossed his arms with an annoyed look on his face. "Douche," he mouthed to himself quietly.</p><p>"Alright, it's... 4:37 PM. What's say we all grab a bite to eat, maybe do some sightseeing?¬†</p><p>Surprisingly, the boys in the band agreed in unison. Mic, however, stood beside them stone-faced, for she had other plans in mind.</p><p>"Uhh... Mic... you¬†<em>are</em>¬†coming, right?"</p><p>She shook her head. "I'm... not actually all that hungry. I'll probably order some room service or something when the time comes, and I'm also pretty tired. You guys go on without me, I'll be fine. Besides, it'll be good to get a break from this fucking sausage fest, even if it's only for a little while," she smiled, holding back a laugh. She liked her bandmates, but sometimes being the only girl in a band with three loud guys was incredibly exhausting.</p><p>Knife and Nickel, a little offended, nodded anyway, too hungry to really comment otherwise. Baseball, on the other hand, scoffed and grunted in annoyance.</p><p>"Please don't leave me with Tweedle-dumb and Tweedle-dumber... you balance out these insecure alpha nightmares!"¬†</p><p>Tired from the lack of sleep in the van, she stood by her decision and shrugged. "Sorry man, my mind's made up. You guys go and have a guys' night out or something, I don't care, as long as you don't hurt yourselves or some shit. Besides, I spend way too much time with you guys as it is, so please... go away..."</p><p>"Well, we'd love to stay and chat," Nickel rolled his eyes, "but we got an all-you-can-eat buffet meal with our names on it. Have fun... or don't," he rolled his eyes.</p><p>Microphone nodded her head. "Alrighty then. Well... go... get outta here already," she insisted, shooing them away with gentle slaps of the hotel's paper map. They went on the elevator while Mic tried to get comfortable.</p><p><br/>She smirked, knowing full well that she finally had some time alone. It was nice to finally experience silence; there was a huge lack of that luxury in her life as it is. She grabbed her room key from her right front pocket, unlocking the door. What greeted her was pretty standard hotel garb: a stool to hang suitcases, a blanket that looks like a band-aid, a shower with unreasonable water pressure; the whole nine yards.</p><p>Exhausted, Mic lay down on the bed and took a quick nap. When she woke up, she was greeted with a pitch-black room, the digital clock serving as the only source of light. Looking at the clock, it read 9:32 PM.¬†</p><p>"Fuck... it's been five hours and still no sign of the guys. They must be getting drunk of their asses again," she replied as she shook her head, getting up to take a quick shower. She exited the bathroom a little while later and realized that, as much as she enjoyed some good time alone, it was far too quiet for her liking. To alleviate the loneliness, she decided to go down to the lobby, an environment that seemed far more homely. The woman heard a strange commotion in the distance, curious to determine the source.</p><p>After a few seconds of walking forward, she realized that some shmuck was performing his comedy routine. "Hmm... Cheesy's Cavalcade of Cartoony Comedy... sounds lame." She walked in anyway; for Mic was what she referred to herself as a "connoisseur of cringe."</p><p>Cheesy, a struggling stand-up comic, tried his hardest to leave people happier than when he found them. Unfortunately, the task was better said than done. He was about fifteen minutes into his routine, and around a dozen people were in the audience, mostly silent and stone-faced. Several people left beforehand, completely dissatisfied with his performance.¬†</p><p>"So I checked my Twitter last night, and this guy, Dream? Who plays Minecraft? I bet the money he makes is a¬†<em>dream</em>¬†come true? Get it?¬†<em>Dream?"</em></p><p><em>Oh, this is just FANTASTIC,¬†</em>Mic¬†smiled, loving every second of some of the worst attempts at humor she ever heard. It was almost worse than the "comedy" that the improv kids pulled every year, the type of stuff she thought only rich theater kids found funny.¬†</p><p>"This girl gets it!" Cheesy smiled, pointing directly at the woman's face. Needless to say, she was unamused by the gesture. She blushed deeply, embarrassed by his voluntary alienation of her presence.</p><p>"Jesus, you are more disappointing than an unsalted pretzel," she rolled her eyes sarcastically. Her response got a few chuckles from the audience, something that was absent in Cheesy's routine.</p><p>"Heh... isn't that nice," Cheesy said, feeling a little sour.</p><p>"Your jokes make my sexist grandpa look like Bo Burnham." Audible laughter came from the audience this time, a strong slap in the face from the male "comedian."</p><p>Ten more minutes of the back-and-forth interaction led Cheesy to cut his routine short. When the embarrassment was over, Mic hung out in the lounge, drinking some tea to cool off. He walked towards her with a noticeable pout adorning his face.</p><p>"You ruined my comedy routine! You should feel ashamed of yourself!"</p><p>Mic rolled her eyes, crossing her arms. Approaching the young man in front of her lowered his confidence; for he was a few inches shorter than her.</p><p>"You're giving yourself too much credit, Buster... I'm using this term loosely, but those 'jokes' of yours... fuck, man... I've seen funnier things from a five-year-old," she retorted, crossing her arms.</p><p>Not knowing what her deal was, he scoffed loudly. "You'll pay for what you've done, making a fool out of my work!" Mic widened her eyes and scoffed, putting an arm out to introduce herself. "Look, I don't know what you want from me, but I'm too damn busy to really hold a grudge or whatever, so I think we should just start over. I'm Microphone, nice to meet ya. Friends call me Mic for short." She exchanged a slight smirk at the man, hoping he'd just forget about it too.</p><p>Cheesy was beyond confused, but he shook her head regardless. Better this than heckling more of his jokes, right?</p><p>"Uh, Cheesy... nice to meet you too," he replied back, resting his hands on his rainbow suspenders. The two looked like night and day in terms of their clothing styles; Cheesy dressed like he got bullied constantly, while Mic's wardrobe was 80% black band T-shirts, black jeans, chokers, and spiked jewelry. The man sat down beside her, still a little wary of trusting her.</p><p>As Mic took another sip from her iced tea, she looked into his eyes directly and sighed. The look of failure in his eyes was something she knew all too well. "Hey man... I still think your jokes are garbage, but... clearly, you're struggling in the entertainment business, and trust me, I've been through hell and back trying to make something of myself too," she admitted, her vulnerability confusing her to no end. "I guess I had a moment of weakness and forgot what that felt like for a little bit..."</p><p>She was an entertainer too? The news piqued his interest. "Oh really? I find that hard to believe," he dismissed swiftly, taking a sip of Coke from a nearby vending machine. "Tiktok doesn't count as entertainment, by the way. No need to be a horse and make a¬†<em>foal</em>¬†out of yourself!"</p><p>His judgmental reaction triggered a series of memories of Mic's mom underestimating her abilities, her exes downplaying her achievements, her teachers not understanding her aspirations... in a sudden burst of rage, she grabbed Cheesy by the shirt and hoisted him up, ready to punch him. "Are you fucking kidding me? You go and perform what might be the cringiest garbage I've ever seen, and you have the AUDACITY to act as you can step all over the obstacles I've conquered? You know nothing of what I've done, where I've been, and what I'm doing! Next time you decide to berate my passions, stay in your goddamn lane!"</p><p>Cheesy quickly went into fight-or-flight mode, remorse starting to overcome him. Unfortunately, he didn't process conflict well, so he dropped the ball when trying to console her. "Whoa whoa there, I was just trying to make a joke! Cool it! No need to act like I work with compost... it's¬†<em>degrading,"¬†</em>he chuckled, slapping his knee happily.</p><p>Mic groaned and let him go, dropping him onto the carpeted floors of the hotel with no hesitation.¬† "Unbelievable..." She groaned, just about ready to wish him good riddance. Almost immediately, Cheesy initially saw this as a second chance, and he refused to let her go away without making her laugh.</p><p>"Wait, hold on for a second! Don't you want to hear the rest of the routine?"¬†</p><p>Without much thought, Mic laughed loudly. "Not really... you incorrectly stereotyped me and deemed that humor. Not sure there's anything else you can do to make a fool out of yourself. Goodbye," she responded, a stern look piercing into the comedian's eyes. But as the woman was about to take the stairs up to the fourth floor, Cheesy saw the conversation as yet another performance, and this time, he wasn't going to let each other's differences get in the way of bombing yet again, so he crept slowly behind her. Visible annoyance began to form.</p><p>"Buddy, did you listen to anything I said before, or do you have your head stuck in your ass? I said get lost!"</p><p>Cheesy just giggled and continued to walk alongside her, her insults not budging in the slightest. "Maybe I do, maybe I don't. I'm gonna make you laugh even it kills me!"¬†</p><p>The guitarist, however, was not so interested in his declaration and refused to acknowledge him, trying her very hardest not to lose her cool. Cheesy, on the other hand, was listing off some of his other material: some more horrible puns.</p><p>"I'm reading a book about zero gravity, and¬†<em>I just can't put it down.</em>¬†Hey Mic, why do teenage girls travel in odd-numbered groups?¬†<em>Because they can't even.¬†</em>Hey Mic, did you hear about the World War I veteran who survived both pepper spray and mustard gas?¬†<em>He was a seasoned veteran</em>."</p><p>¬†When Mic got to her and Baseball's room, she turned to the man, hands on her hips, legs spread out, and raised her eyebrows, looking straight into his pupils. Her eyes like daggers, she approached Cheesy menacingly, using her words carefully to make sure he couldn't misconstrue her words or ask for more stage time.</p><p>"Please, Cheesy... I will give you $100 in cold hard cash if you walk away from me right now. I can't even begin to describe the density of illness I feel in my bones right now... that is how horrible your company has been."</p><p>She rolled her eyes and shook her head, scanning her room key at the door. When the light on the sensor flashed green, she walked inside, Cheesy rushing inside. Taking a quick look at the amenities inside, he smiled and nodded. "Not bad, not bad at all," he whistled, putting his hands on his hips. "I really have to do more hotel venues at some point... gotta spread my gift to others across the country, right?"</p><p>"Replace the word gift with impending plague, and yeah, I'd probably agree with you on that," she replied blankly, taking a seat on the furniture nearby her bed. Baseball protested about this earlier, but Microphone took her electric guitar inside with her prior to checking in, claiming that being in the same room with it would help her sleep at night. She approached the guitar case nearby and opened it, messing with the knobs so the strings would stay in tune. Grabbing her lucky golden pick her dad gave to her prior to the divorce, she hummed a ballad to herself, strumming some somber chords to ease her agitation.¬†</p><p>Cheesy was astounded by what he was witnessing. He grew increasingly jealous by the second, watching the delicate motions of her right wrist plucking every individual string, her left wrist seamlessly moving up and down and the neck of the instrument when needed... her voice was beyond beautiful. Regret quickly washed over him, the man blushing with embarrassment.¬†</p><p>He clapped for her quietly, nodding with delight at the tantalizing performance. Sure, it may have been low-profile, and incredibly stripped-down, but the simplicity of it all enhanced her work.</p><p>"Microphone... you really¬†<em>are</em>¬†talented," he admitted, scratching the back of his head, finding it hard to keep eye contact with her. "Both your voice and playing were fantastic, and well... I owe you a big fat apology. I suppose the last thing you want to hear is my voice, so I think I should finally be heading out. You're a good woman, Mic," he waved at her, reaching for the doorknob.</p><p>Mic simply smiled. "Wait... Cheesy..."</p><p>He turned towards her, waiting to hear what she had to say next.</p><p>"...Look, as annoying as you were out there, I expected you to keep babbling on about your jokes and stuff. I respect that you apologized, truly," she nodded in approval. "Wait, hold on, lemme go and get something real quick."</p><p>She grabbed her suitcase and pulled out a baggie from a small compartment on the side, smelling the stench like it belonged to a stack of fresh pancakes. "Do you smoke by any chance? Not gonna lie, I totally forgot I packed this, given how dysfunctional my bandmates can be and all... we've both had a long day, so why not relax a little?" She handed him a wad of paper, a lighter, and some green plants to the man.</p><p>He shook his head and smiled bashfully. "Sorry, this guy doesn't really smoke or drink. I tried that stuff a few years back; wasn't very kind to me."</p><p>"It's okay, Cheesy, the drummer in my band doesn't really smoke either, says it's bad for his productivity. Funny he says that, cause usually, this shit gives me all the inspiration I need...heh heh," she uttered, pressing the button on the lighter.¬† Mic lit the end of the joint and inhaled before slowly exhaling it out, a large cloud of smoke getting into Cheesy's face. The secondhand smoke led him to cough up a storm.</p><p>"My bad dude... didn't mean to do that," she giggled, wafting the smoke away. She started to lounge up on the couch, this time taking on more of a relaxed stance. The chemicals slowly began to alter her mood, almost as if the guitarist could see her tensions shrivel up and die right in front of her.</p><p>Cheesy sat next to her, not really sure what else to say. He patted his legs, checked on his phone, and watched some Inanimate Insanity on his phone, but nothing really helped him unwind from the tension that was brewing inside.</p><p>"Yo Cheddar, my man... I got a hankering for some munchies. Got any Funyuns or something?"¬†</p><p>
<em>Well, I guess that something's better than nothing...</em>
</p><p>He scavenged through the minifridge and thankfully found some snacks. It was a shame that he had to part with the few dollar bills that were left in his wallet, but if she was hungry, he would be the one to deliver. He'd do quite a lot to ensure her happiness after angering her earlier.</p><p>"Here you go, Mic... I couldn't find Funyuns, but I found some Lays. That good enough for you?"</p><p>Mic swiftly opened the bag, shoving a handful of the salty contents inside of her mouth. "You're a real lifesaver man, I owe you one," she winked, not hesitating to fill her suddenly large appetite with no bounds.¬†</p><p>¬†</p><p>A few minutes passed and Cheesy was feeling a little trapped. On one hand, he felt wrong for sticking here with her in the hotel for so long, but the companionship, especially with a girl, was a nice refresher compared to a usual Friday night... which was just him and his right hand...¬†</p><p>Microphone's eyes, now a vivid shade of pink, began to dilate slightly, perpetually half-lidded as the world started to distort itself around her. Her senses were completely misaligned with one other, leaving her in a lethargic state of blissful euphoria. Cheesy would pick up various episodes of laughter, but her delayed speech left room for little comprehension.¬†</p><p>Suddenly, the guitarist began to feel pressure from down below, the desires of unhinged horniness becoming stronger by the second.</p><p>She felt constricted by the lack of freedom her clothes brought her, so she slowly removed her black tee and jeans, leaving her in a beautifully laced black bra and panties. Cheesy was absolutely taken aback by such a promiscuous display, easily taking note that the weed made her do such a naughty thing. Regardless of exactly why it happened, he refused to interrupt the course of events at play.</p><p>"Heh heh, sorry man, it was getting kinda... kinda hot in here," she uttered slowly, moving her head around 180 degrees as if somebody else was in the room with her. "Yeah I know, my pepperonis were absolutely roasting!" She pressed her breasts together with a smile, later laughing at the way they felt, the way they would squish up against her chest. All Cheesy could do was try and cool himself off with his shirt collar, swallowing a gulp of air.¬†</p><p>Microphone was a little too baked to really notice or worry about his nervousness, gliding her fingers across her bare skin while letting out a cute series of giggles. She refused to hesitate to play with her DD-sized tits any longer, letting out some soft moans from the enhanced stimulation. Everything became twice as sensitive, making it almost impossible to restrain herself in front of her guest.</p><p>She stared back at Cheesy, her fingers heading under her panties. "Well isn't this just a damn shame," she giggled seductively, "I get so fucking horny when I'm high... what am I gonna do?~." She began to burst into a fit of laughter, Cheesy following suit fast.¬†<em>Damn, her laugh sure is infectious,</em>¬†Cheesy thought to himself, hiding his boner from plain sight as best as he could.¬†</p><p>Mic got off of her chair and crawled on over to Cheesy, her eyes half-lidded and her breasts pressed against his chest. "Hey man, it would mean the world to me... wait... what was I gonna say? OH YEAH! Yeah, you'd be doing me a real solid if you'd fuck my brains out~," she chuckled once more, dipping a finger inside of her pussy and licking her fluid in front of him.</p><p>Her body led Cheesy to freeze in shock, gawking at the way her curves were in all the right places. Her euphoric confidence and matter-of-fact obscenity left his cock begging for attention, yearning for touch. He nodded instantaneously, lifting his shirt over his head and revealing his thin yet lean-muscled frame. Mic stared in awe as he unbuckled and unzipped his pants, nervously sliding them down before dropping them onto the floor.</p><p>"Cheesy... you um... you look kinda¬†<em>hot</em>~," she finished, her face glowing brightly in the dim yellow light of the hotel room. The heat flashed across his face, his heart beating with rigor at the sound of her kind words. "May I?" He asked politely. Mic nodded and turned around accordingly.</p><p>Trying not to overdo his overt excitement any more than he previously had before, Cheesy began to unfasten her bra, eyes fixed on her chest. As she returned to her original position, his heart skipped a beat, absolutely in awe at Microphone's voluptuousness.¬†</p><p>Mic pushed him gently onto the right bed and crawled onto his lap, eliciting a grunt of pleasure from the male as he placed one hand on her butt and wrapped his other arm around her. The two gazing lustfully at one another, they exchanged a series of sloppy kisses, exploring each other's bodies as their hot breaths intertwined. She reached down with her right arm and felt the bulge in his underwear, tracing a finger up and down its length, pumping it tenderly with just the right amount of pressure. Cheesy gave her ass a soft smack, rubbing the spot tenderly afterward, making her release a pent-up moan.</p><p>"Hmm... it's s-so veiny and... h-hahh?" Mic's comment was cut short as Cheesy rolled her off of him and onto the soft bed below. Gazing at her with anticipation, she pulled off her boxers and kicked them off the bed. "Oh yeah, that'll do the trick just fine~," Mic whispered in between a series of hot breaths, an excited smile adorning her face. His length was just shy of six inches - not too short to be a disappointment all around, but not too long that the whole experience would split her in half. She drooled at his cock, watching it twitch every so often.¬†</p><p>Cheesy took hold of her panties and slid them down her thighs before dropping them to the side just as Mic did with his boxers. The guitarist instinctively spread her legs apart for the comedian, her pussy flushed pink and swollen. There was no surprise that her treasure was damp as a typical Florida summer.</p><p>Mic shuddered with pleasure, giving him a dopey smile. Cheesy's eyes motioned down south to her glistening sex. Leaning over slightly, he placed her hands on her hips and slid his dick just over her lips. "So, I'm really doing this, huh?" Cheesy replied nervously, his body quaking from the pressure. What if he couldn't perform for her properly? What if she became bored too quickly?</p><p>"Unngh... Cheesy... just fuck me... please! Please just do it! It's too much! I can't go another second without that sweet-ass dick!"</p><p>Just as she had requested, he took his dick with one hand and guided it down to her wet folds. As the first couple of inches penetrated her pussy, she gave a shuddering gasp. She was wondrously warm and tight, her juices acting as a perfect lubricant, allowing him to push deeper with ease. He placed his hands on the softest thighs he had ever felt, shoving the rest of his length inside of her. "Goddammit, man! Gimme more... m-more!" She groaned, tongue out like a dog. Gripping her thighs with greater force, he slowly began a good rhythm of thrusts. "W-wow... Cheesy... i-it feels so warm... and huge... F-fuck that feels good... d-don't stop," she moaned, her head tilting back and eyes closing, a beet-red blush decorating a wide grin.¬†</p><p>For a while, Cheesy found himself gradually speeding up. He wondered if he was going too fast, but noticing her varied expressions, that concern soon left his mind. He watched with glee as his dick pulled inside and out, again and again like clockwork, manhood covered with her essence with every pullback. He leaned a little further over her, his eyes moving up towards her breasts, watching them bounce as her body rocked forward.</p><p>"C-Cheesy...! Hahh...! Faster!" Mic gasped after some interval of time. Closing his eyes, Cheesy obeyed her commands, his soft grunts gradually getting louder as his pleasure mounted, feeling her pussy squeeze his shaft tight. "C-Cheesy... you feel amazing... claim me as yours with that monster cock!"</p><p>Cheesy pushed deeper and deeper with every forward thrust, feeling his balls sway heavily at the base of his member. It felt as though they were tensing up as his dick responded with a hard, excited throb. Microphone grabbed one of the pillows and bit down on it to silence her moans, which increased both in frequency and volume. Now going balls-deep, he released a loud groan of pleasure, his body now audibly smacking into hers. The bed was rocking back and forth , almost bumping into the wall.¬†<em>I really hope the guys haven't come back yet</em>, she thought to herself for a short moment.</p><p>As Cheesy's heavenly rod continued to fuck Mic's cushy vagina, even the pillow she bit onto could barely muffle her yells of raw, primordial pleasure. "Hrrrrrrrrrf, nnnnnngngnhnAAHHHn!!" Mic's sudden outburst made his eyes snap in panic. "Mi... Microphone... e-everything alright?" He gasped, out of breath. She opened her eyes and nodded viciously, her arms draped over her head. "Y-yes, y-yes Cheesy... just... please... d-don't stop! MORE! I NEED MORE! Give it to me as fast as you can, you cringy comedian!"</p><p>A little hurt but overall aroused by her words, Cheesy leaned as far over her as possible. Placing his hands next to her body, he gritted his teeth and closed his eyes, humping as fast as he could. The two heard sounds of their skin slapping against one another rhythmically, entrancing themselves even further. "F-fuck... F-FUCK YEAH, CHEESY! POUND MY PUSSY!" Mic's supersonic cries for stimulation pushed his desire to new heights, as his dick almost squirmed inside of her. He knew he wouldn't last much longer if they kept this up; he could feel it coming (lol), flooding him with satisfaction he had rarely experienced before in his entire life.¬†</p><p>"Ohhhh~... Nggh~... C-Cheesy, I.... I-I... Mmmmmmm, gonna cum! Hhaaa... OOOHHHH YEAH!!"¬†</p><p>Before Cheesy could respond to her exclamation, she began to grunt and moan loudly, feeling her pussy latch onto his dick. She arched her back and pinched her eyes shut as she bit down onto the pillow as hard as she could, a smile curling at the corners of her mouth. A series of rhythmic spurts of slick juices coated his throbbing member and spurted from her sex. The display was so mesmerizing that he could barely fight back his release; the sound and sight of her cumming for him was better than anything else he had ever experienced.¬†</p><p>"Oh... Mic, honey... I c-can't... I'm a-about to...," he groaned, pleasure overtaking every nerve in his body. "Stay in or pull out?"</p><p>"Whatever you want! I-I'm on birth control, so it's okay however you decide!"</p><p>Cheesy could only grunt a response. Pulling back one last time, he took his excitedly throbbing member and jammed it into her womb. Finally, unable to hold back any longer, he closed his eyes shut as he reached the pinnacle of the sexual cycle. A thick strand of cum shot into her, splattering inside her sex, then a second, a third, and a fourth, each shooting with greater intensity. Microphone decided to arouse him even further and displayed an ahegao face for him, peace signs adding to the explosive impact of his seed.</p><p>As the force of his cumshots died down, he pulled out, watching with delight as a drop of cum leaked outside her pussy. Her tongue out, hand on her stomach, she was 1000 percent satisfied with the events that had transpired. "Well... not gonna lie, my man... that was... pretty fucking incredible. You really were an annoying little twerp, but my god, what you did just now was just sooooo... so¬†<em>hot</em>~," she admitted, using the pillowcase to wipe some of the sweat off of her face. "Hey, do you know what would really be hot? Take a picture of me with your cum inside you... use it as a personal souvenir for when my band gets big!"</p><p>Cheesy gasped, still reeling from the afterglow. "You're in a band?"</p><p>Mic giggled. "Yep, and I'm the leader of it! Pretty cool, huh?"</p><p>All the comedian could do at the moment was nod, grab his phone, and activate the camera. He could feel his dick twitch slightly as Mic laid back down on the bed, winking for Cheesy while showing devil horns with her hands. After the picture was taken, he sank down beside her, exhausted and breathing heavily. Both of them were exceptionally drained, neither of which had the strength to sit up.¬†</p><p>It was about 1 AM. The boys finally returned from a night of wondrous adventure, excited to tell Microphone about it. The sound of an unlocked door terrified the girl, leading her to rush into the bathroom with the clothes she had taken off beforehand. The three were talking amongst themselves and screamed at the asleep, naked man that they saw in the bed.</p><p>"Well...guess this is what I get for having fun on the wild side," she shrugged.</p><p>

<h2 class="heading">Nickel x Balloon Part 2</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>In case the title didn't scream it out already, this¬†<b>is</b>¬†<b>the second part of a two-parter,</b>¬†so feel free to go on ahead and check it out if you haven't already. Keep in mind that I wrote the first part back in January, so if continuity is lacking, that's most likely why.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The hours following their little hookup were painstakingly long. Nickel and Balloon constantly broke in a sweat when they encountered one another during the day, anticipating a night like no other. The two often exchanged air kisses, masturbatory gestures, and the like. During dinnertime, the two were so bold with their nonverbal cues that others slowly began to pick up on what was going on, whispering and gossiping about their theories about them.</p><p>The contestants were getting hazy, their eyes getting heavy as they concluded yet another day of nothing going on. Nickel and Balloon, on the other hand, were wide awake. While eating dinner, they discussed where and when they would reconvene as discreetly as possible. Sucking imaginary dicks and kissing the sky in broad daylight; what a way to keep a secret, am I right?</p><p>They agreed to meet near the Calm Down Cabana at 11:30 PM, a place nobody ever dared to go late at night for reasons they couldn't quite explain. Goo and Bow started a rumor that ghosts lurked around the site, a wild story that Test Tube and Cabby tried their hardest to discredit.</p><p>After letting Balloon in like the clear chivalrous guy he is, he looked around and surveyed the premises two more times before closing the door to the cabana and turning on the light.</p><p>"Ugh, MAN! We lounge around more often than actual challenges, but wow. Today felt like forever, huh, Nickel?" Balloon questioned him, wiping any potential sweat from his forehead.</p><p>"Oh, definitely, Balloon... it's about time some action happens around here; I never thought I'd die of boredom at a circus," Nickel sneered quietly, trying to get the hair out of his eyes.</p><p>"A circus? Why's that?"</p><p>"Because everybody here's part of a freakshow, and the illusion of entertainment is a fucking joke," he replied bluntly, giving Balloon little time to apply logic to Nickel's reasoning, or lack thereof.</p><p>"Oh, whatever," Balloon replied with a chuckle. He approached the skinny boy with a little bit of sexual suggestiveness, feeling his body heat coupled with his own. "Stop talking, and let's have some fun, huh? I didn't suck you dry just so you could avoid me, didn't I, big boy~?" He giggled seductively, drawing little circles around Nickel's chest.¬†</p><p>The sarcastic little goblin tried his hardest not to seem aroused, but his feelings were evident when he touched him, his libido higher than the moon.¬†</p><p>"Oh, don't worry, Balloon... I'll make sure you'll end up just like a KFC when I'm through with you..."</p><p>"I'm sorry... KFC?"</p><p>"I'm gonna give you a good fill-up, dumbass~," the more petite boy cackled quietly, navigating his hands down Balloon's lovingly plump behind. Nickel hated to admit it, but he was a sucker for big boys, and Balloon's physique was something he couldn't bear to resist.</p><p>"Ohhohohoho... Nickel, you sly dog!"</p><p>The two exchanged seductive, lust-filled grunts as the two felt each other up, admiring each other's opposing body types. Balloon's mind grew rife with filth at the thought of his rock-hard member gracing his orifices, so much so that his dick was already at full mast. Nickel quickly took notice and decided to comment.</p><p>"Heh heh, already down to fuck? It's always the losers that live to please~," he nodded, smacking his fat ass with glee. Balloon gasped and moaned under Nickel's control, starving for more of his dominance. His lust led him to get hard, his 6 inches of gay glory coming out to play.</p><p>"S-shut up, m-mmm~," Balloon cooed, trying his hardest not to pant like a dog. He was at his wit's end, any semblance of reasoning quickly vanishing before their very eyes. He looked into Nickel's eyes with a burning passion.¬†</p><p>"N-Nickel, p-please~..."</p><p>"Please, what? Beta subs like you have to beg and plead, remember? So tell me<em>¬†exactly¬†</em>what you want, and we won't have any problems, capisce?"</p><p>The way Nickel berated him turned him on like nothing else. What he wouldn't give for the twink to take him right then and there.</p><p>"N-Nickel, take me as yours... r-rail me like the s-scum of the earth I am, d-daddy!~" Balloon's pupils dilated as Nickel swiftly pinned him to the wall, his arms held behind him to leave him exposed to the cold world.</p><p>Balloon's complete subservience left him sweating bullets, leading him to take off his clothes, starting with his shirt and then his pants and underwear. Nickel and his naked body were inches away from his cock, begging for stimulation.</p><p>"Get on the floor and take those clothes off right now. A slut like you should be used to this by now~," Nickel cooed, grabbing Balloon's waist and leaning forward, his penis sandwiched in between his legs.</p><p>Balloon obeyed without a second thought, reaching for the hem of his shirt and pulling it upward, showcasing his gut in the process. After the two were finally more comfortable, Nickel wrapped his arms around Balloon and gave his ass a firm smack. With Nickel's assistance, his chode was finally given some breathing room.</p><p>"I don't see you on the floor! Get to it, cocksleeve!"</p><p>"Yes, daddy! Anything for daddy!" Balloon yelled back, getting on his knees and feeling the cold ground on his sweaty body. He stuck his behind out for Nickel, giggling with glee at what was to come.</p><p>Nickel sat on his knees, pulling Balloon's body closer to his. He felt his backside as lovingly as possible, giving his ass a gentle massage. He couldn't help but stick his dick in between, loving how his cheeks squished and squeezed his length like a good hug.</p><p>"D-daddy, please! Fuck me now!" Balloon begged, wiggling his ass and spreading his cheeks, presenting as best as he could for his dom.</p><p>Nickel giggled and patted his ass gently. "You really are a pathetic piece of trash, aren't you? Oh, alright, I suppose you've waited long enough," he teased slyly, grabbing his shaft and lubing himself and Balloon up for the events that were about to ensue.</p><p>"H-how did you manage to bring lube to a competition show?"</p><p>"You don't know me at all, don't you, pretty boy? Now shut it and let me ram that bussy of yours~..."</p><p>Nickel didn't hesitate to slam his massive rod inside, Balloon tensing up and whimpering from the discomfort. He grabbed his lover's hands and clasped them tight, trying his hardest to adjust as fast as possible.¬†</p><p>"Damn... even when I lubed you up, you're tight as fuck... so humiliating, isn't it?~," he teased once more. He gave Balloon's right cheek another smack, his handprint clearly visible.</p><p>"AhAH! A-all for y-you, s-sweetie..."</p><p>Nickel waited for a few more seconds, his patience hanging by a thread. He was an asshole, sure, but he was going to wait for Balloon to adjust; he wasn't a monster, after all.</p><p>"O-okay, I t-think I'm ready," he stuttered, looking into Nickel's eyes from behind as he held on to the ground for dear life. Nickel nodded and slowly slipped himself back inside, first entering the tip and waiting, then submerging another inch every twenty seconds to help him get acclimated. While his sexual partner gently slid himself in, Balloon took ten deep breaths, breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth. He tried to squeeze his finger with his ass, holding the squeeze for a few seconds before relaxing. In Balloon's mind, he started with the top of his head and slowly relaxed his muscles, "scanning" down his spine, down his legs, and ending at his hole.¬†</p><p>"He...heh heh... that's a lot better~," Balloon replied, slurring his speech as the pain slowly withered away into nothingness. Awkward grunts and grumbles transformed into a mix of guttural moans and pleasurable snarls.</p><p>"T-that's it, d-daddy... p-peg me... p-peg me f-faster!" He exclaimed, feeling his arms rub against the ground as Nickel's member began to slam in and out gradually. Balloon couldn't help but bite his lip, feeling a strong, stiff feeling below.</p><p>Nickel gave a reassuring nod and sped his pace up gradually, trying his hardest not to make sure he would hurt the horny guy.¬†</p><p>After a few minutes of the two going to town on each other's bodies, their climaxes approached fast, indicating an end to their fun. Regardless, the two tried to make the most of it.</p><p>"Balloon, I'm s-so close... f-fuck... I'm gonna blow any second!"¬†</p><p>"D-damn it, just do it! DO IT!" His screams of pleasure echoed across the room. He would've covered his ears in any other circumstance, but the pleasure distracted him from such discomfort.</p><p>A few seconds later, Nickel thrust into Balloon as hard as he could before stopping abruptly. The chubbier one out of the two let out a series of happy hums and whines as he felt his belly inflate from the piping hot semen entering his hole. Balloon's climax came a few seconds later, his cock twitching as ropes of cum began to stain the hardwood floors below him.</p><p>Nickel pulled out of him and smiled warmly, pulling Balloon in for a gentle kiss. "You took me like a fucking champ. I gotta say, I'm impressed."</p><p>Balloon wrapped his arms around him, unable to avert his eyes from his loving gaze. "Aww, stop it... don't give me all the credit! You were just... amazing," he responded happily, kissing his cheek multiple times with the deepest affection.</p><p>"C'mon, sexy... let's get each other cleaned up and go to bed; I'm beyond drained now," Nickel uttered, helping Balloon up and exiting the cabana, now fully dressed. The two gave each other a series of romantic gestures before heading to their respective cabins, ready to endure another dull day on the island.</p><p>WORD COUNT: 1687</p>
