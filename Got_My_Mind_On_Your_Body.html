<p> </p><p> </p><p>OJ was tired.</p><p> </p><p>Not in a I-wanna-go-to-bed tired, in more of a I-want-to-stop-working kind of way. So I guess the more exact word would be exhausted then. OJ was exhausted. But luckity for him! He was already done with his work.</p><p>Which pretty much meant he could go home, which technically speaking his home was his work place. Though that wasn't much of a bad thing, cause that meant he didnt have to do all the work of driving.</p><p> </p><p>He walked to the first room on the first floor, his and Paper's room. He grabbed his keyes from his pocket and and unlocked the door, doing a small knock to alert his roommate before he walked inside.</p><p>OJ opened the door and walked in, closing said door and locking it behind him. He smiled once his eyes landed onto Paper. Paper looking over at him and smiling back. "OJ!" He said, walking towards him.</p><p> </p><p>Paper kissed the other gently, OJ kissing back. Did I mention they were boyfriends? No? Whoops. Well there you have it I guess. They pulled away and chuckled. "How was the complaints today?"</p><p>OJ sighed. "Not that much, and they weren't as bad. It was the twins today." Paper hummed."Cherries?" He nodded. "Yin and Yang as well." OJ complained to his boyfriend. "Today just left me all stressed."</p><p> </p><p>Paper, caressing his face with his hand, spoke. "Maybe you just need a little stress relief, don't you think?" He tilted his his head, which left OJ a little confused. "Stress relief? Wh- Oh." OJ mumbled.</p><p>OJ looked at Paper and blushed, I mean the topic of sex between the two of them wasn't new, but they've never really <em>had</em> it. They were both ready, plus OJ did need some 'stress relief' as Paper had described it.</p><p> </p><p>"Unless you aren't ready yet, we can cuddle instead if that's what you want?" Paper added on, making OJ smile on how he cared so much. OJ shook his head. "No, I'm up for it!" He said, placing his hand on his.</p><p>"Okay, that's good, cause I already prepped myself before you got here." That made OJ choke. "You what?" Paper simply dmiled and shrugged. "Nothing Oj, now c'mon we've been standing here long enough!"</p><p> </p><p>OJ was dragged to their bed by his boyfriend, the two of them moving onto the bed. Paper held his hand and tugged him closer before kissing him, OJ being cut off guard by the kiss, but he leaned into it anyways.</p><p>They held the kiss for a hot minute before pulling awau from each other, panting quietly before OJ began to take his shirt off. Paper following afterwards. Short kisses in between undressing.</p><p> </p><p>Soon the two of them were left with just their boxers, they stared at each other for a bit before Paper made a move, softly pushing him down to simply kiss him. OJ having to hesitation to kiss his lover back.</p><p>Paper was sitting on his lap, kissing his boyfriend before gently bucked his hips, causing a small reaction from OJ. He pulled away. "You're okay with me riding you, right?" Paper asked, wanting some consent first.</p><p> </p><p>OJ scoffed. "Of course I am, Paper." Paper put his hands up. "Okay, okay. My bad for simply asking. "Whatever." Paper chuckled and put his hands on his boxers, rubbing him through the boxers.</p><p>That elicited a small gasp from OJ, soon Paper slipped off his boxers as well as his own short after. The two had a small moment of silence before Paper moved onto a comfy position on OJ's lap.</p><p> </p><p>The two chuckled as they held each others hand, Paper kissing him lovingly before pushing himself down on his cock. Both of them making a small noise into the kiss. Paper pulled away to breathe.</p><p>They were both panting, getting used to the feeling of it all. Their faces both flushed. After a wminute or so of this Paper looked at OJ. "I'm ready to move. Are you?" He asked him, and he nodded.</p><p> </p><p>"Words, please." OJ whined before speaking. "Yes, I'm ready." He nodded and neaned down to kiss him. Paper began to slowly move himself up and down on his dick, letting out moans every now and then.</p><p>OJ groaned and let his hands wander onto Paper's hips, Paper didn't mind. Finding any touch from OJ like a blessing from heaven. They both fekt amazing right now, even though it was only the beginning.</p><p> </p><p>They continued this slow pace, the two of them adjusted to it already. They began to go faster, Paper bouncing at a slightly facter pace and OJ bucking his hips up, which never failed to make Paper moans.</p><p>OJ bit his lip, Paper placing his cold hands on his chest to stabilize himself as he went faster. Making OJ gasp out and whine. "Fuck, Paper.." OJ moaned, catching his attention. Paper smiled at his reaction.</p><p> </p><p>Moans were echoing throughout the room, the both of them feeling as if they both were in euphoria. They both slowly got closer and closer to their orgasm, Paper's moans were a fact of this. </p><p>OJ felt close as well, squirming around as he got closer and closer. Paper came with one last bounce, that sending OJ over the edge. He let out a moan as he came as well. Making Paper gasp quietly.</p><p> </p><p>The room was now filled with loud pants, the two of them showering in the after glow of their orgasm. Paper leaned foward after catching his breath and kissed OJ. Mumbling the words; "I love you."</p><p>"I love you too." OJ said back, the two staring at each other lovingly before both quietly giggling. They did, truly love each other. And honestly, they wouldn't have it any other way at all.</p><p> </p><p>They brought each other into a kiss again, it filled with love and so many incomprehensible emotions. Yeah it was sappy, but who gave two shits? No one. No one at all.</p><p>So caught up in one another, they didnt dare to remember or remind one another about the fact that the walls in the hotel weren't sound proof. But that was for another day.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
