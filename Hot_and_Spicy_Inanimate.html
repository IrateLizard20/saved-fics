<p>Paper sat at the complainants' desk looking through the written complaints. When no one is at the desk they put their complaint into a box and at the end of the week Paper has to look through it.</p><p>He sorted through the actual complaints and salts "OJ please date me" slips. He threw salts "complaint" away and looked at the small pile of actual complaints.</p><p>"This shouldn't take too long to look through!" Paper thought as he opened the first one, which was submitted by Nickel.</p><p>After skimming through it he took note of what it said and went on to the next one, then the next one, then the next one, until he was left with one more. Before he opened it he heard something coming from OJ's room. It sounded like it was in pain.</p><p>Paper walked over to the door and listened in. He was complaining about budgeting and repairs. Paper opens the door.</p><p>"OJ?" He asks peaking in. OJ looks up from his desk. He looked exhausted.</p><p>"Oh, Paper? Did you finish looking through the complaints?" He asks.</p><p>"I have one left. I just heard you groan and came to see if you were ok." He explains closing the door behind him as he walks in.</p><p>"Ah... you see I've been pretty stressed over bills and stuff. I thought this hotel stuff would be a fun thing for everyone! Turns out it's only fun for the guests." He sighs sinking into his chair. Paper pats his back.</p><p>"Well, you got me! If you need anything I'll be here for you!" Paper smiles. OJ relaxes.</p><p>"Thanks. You've actually been a big help for only being a guest here." OJ laughs.</p><p>"Oh! I thought I was an employee or an unpaid intern?" He says.</p><p>"Do you want to get paid?" OJ asks, tensing up a bit. Paper thinks for a second.</p><p>"Well... you don't have to pay me with money." He blushes. "Just giving me somewhere to stay is enough." OJ shakes his head. He rubs his eyes and sighs.</p><p>"No no, you do so much here! I have to pay you back somehow." He stands up and takes a step towards Paper. Paper takes a step back, bumping into the wall.</p><p>"No really! I'm fine!" Paper feels his heart beating fast, he isn't sure why though." OJ takes another step, putting a hand on Paper's arm.</p><p>"It won't be much but I can pay you $5 an hour?" He says looking down at his hand trying to do the math with his fingers. When he looks back up he notices the small amount of space between them.</p><p>As if it both clicked for them they started to lean in. Their lip almost touching.</p><p>"I could also pay you... this way." OJ says closing the space. They kiss for a split second before OJ pulls back. Paper's face is deep blue.</p><p>"I'm not... opposed to this." He kisses OJ back, this time much deeper. OJ's hands slid down Paper's body, careful to avoid his sides to not get a paper cut.</p><p>Paper's legs shook, his body was on fire. OJ noticed this and brought Paper to the king-sized bed on the opposite side of the room.</p><p>"So... how do we do this?" He asks. Paper shrugs, this was both their first time.</p><p>"I'll lay down and you can be on top?" He suggests. That's the only way they could think of having sex with the least amount of spills.</p><p>Paper rubbed his hands down OJ's cool glass body. He shivered at his touch, his body immediately got erect.</p><p>"That was fast!" Paper blushes.</p><p>"I may be a little touch starved." OJ awkwardly laughs as he rubs Paper's body. Paper lightly moaned as OJ went lower. He uses his thumb and index finger to rub both sides of his lower half. This made Paper's body jerk up, getting erect at the same time.</p><p>OJ got on top of him and slowly lowered himself onto Paper's dick. He covered his mouth. Trying to bite back the pain, he started to regret this until it hit his g-spot. He gasped.</p><p>"First time doing butt stuff?" Paper giggles at his reaction.</p><p>"Why haven't I don't this sooner!" OJ thought to himself as he got used to the feeling. After a few seconds, he lowered himself all the way and started to move. He tried to stay quiet, to not wake up anyone. Paper made whimpering noises, it was cute.</p><p>OJ's legs started to get tired. He pushed through it though. The pain made him enjoy it more for some reason.</p><p>"Ah! OJ I'm gonna!" Paper cums inside OJ. His dick retracts back into him. OJ runs his a few times until he also cums. He gets on Paper's face.</p><p>"Ah! I'm gonna get all soggy now!" He wipes a bit of it off. He looks OJ in the eyes and licks it off his fingers.</p><p>"That was... I needed that." OJ sits down next to Paper.</p><p>"You look less stressed." Paper pats OJ's back. He yawns.</p><p>"I'm extremely tired now," OJ says as he falls asleep. Paper giggles and pulls the covers over him. After laying down for a while he gets up.</p><p>"I'm going to finish up my job." He starts to leave before he quickly turns back and kisses OJ on the cheek.</p><p>He opens the door and walks out.</p><p>"Ahem." Someone says from beside him.</p><p>"GAH!" Paper screams falling to the floor. Nickel stands over him.</p><p>"I have a compla-" um..." He looks at Paper's face, noticing the obvious dried wet spots.</p><p>"You have a complaint? Ok, let me get to the desk." Paper stands up. Nickel watches him.</p><p>"Why do you have dried wet spots on your face?" He asks sitting across from him.</p><p>"Is it that noticeable?! Um! Well- it's from... ha, well?" Paper stammers.</p><p>"You know what, I don't even want to know..." Nickel catches on to the situation.</p><p>The next morning Paper got water poured on him by an angry salt shaker who heard from Nickel about his and OJ's relationship.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Another day of waiting for MePhone to appear and start the next challenge only for nothing to happen was infuriating. Knife was tired to do the same things every day. Hang out with Baseball and Suitcase, talk to Lightbulb, then go to sleep. It's been almost a year of that shit<em>. </em>He just wanted some <em>alone time</em>...</p><p>"And so that's when I said to Pickle ' that's, 's not a chicken!' hahaha!" Lightbulb laughs at her own joke. Knife rolls his eyes.</p><p>"Lightbulb, I'm gonna cut our conversation short. I think I'm gonna go on a walk." Knife rubs his eyes. Lightbulb shoots up excitedly.</p><p>"Ooh! A walk? Can I join! I know a really cool rock we could go see. We can even invite sui-" She starts before Knife cuts her off.</p><p>"I wanna go alone." He sighs.</p><p>"Oh, well go have fun! And if you see a really cool rock that kinda looks like a butt, take a pic with it! It's such a funny rock." She waves bye to Knife. He waves back and starts to walk into the woods.</p><p>After maybe 20 minutes he decided to sit down and take in the scenery. It was beautiful, the warm sun washed over him like a very cozy blanket. He sits down against a tree and leans into it. He could easily fall asleep here. It was nice to get away from everyone.</p><p>He stretched out his body. He didn't realize it before but he was very tense. He arched his back and let out a moan as he felt his body loosen up. He felt his face get warm. God that felt good. He leans forward to stretch his legs, he lets out another moan. This felt so fucking good... He stops stretching and plops back into the tree, he was breathing heavily. His face was flushed.</p><p>He rubbed his face, careful to avoid his sharp side. He was really fucking horny. He ran his hand down his body until he met his slit, it wasn't sealed shut like it normally was. Knife didn't usually jerk off, he wasn't very good at thinking of sexual scenarios, and watching porn never got him hard. He also has never had sex, nobody's the right person. Right now though, all he could think about was Pickle. Lightbulb had mentioned him in one of her stories and he just kept thinking about seeing him.</p><p>Knife rubs his slit, trying to make his dick hard. It took a few deep rubs before it slipped out. He had a pretty big dick, too bad he hasn't shown anyone it. He always wanted bragging rights.</p><p>He rubs the base and squeezes it slightly. He keeps that pressure and brings it up to the tip. His dick squirmed at the touch, it was slimy and slick. It was easy for him to rub it. He brings his hand up and down in a slow steady pattern.</p><p>"Fuck..." He bites his lip. How long has it been since he's done this? At least a year. God, it felt good.</p><p>Knife thought about Pickle, he thought about pinning him against a wall and kissing him deeply. His dick twitched in excitement. He thought about when Pickle loses in a game and groans in frustration, he had a wimpy game-over scream. It sounded like a moan in some cases. Knife thought about that, how he would sound in bed.</p><p>"God... ah! Mmh!!" Knife sped up, precum starts to slip from him. It made his dick wetter and each time he reached his base it would make a wet slapping sound. He used his other hand to dig into the soil next to him. His legs dug into the ground as he pushed them out. This felt amazing. He kept letting out deep moans, he didn't care how loud he was being. He should have been far enough away from everyone.</p><p>He felt his stomach tighten, he didn't want the feeling to go away, he slowed down and eventually stopped. He was so close to cumming, that he wouldn't let himself do it yet. His eyes filled with tears.</p><p>"Fuck! Ah~" He was breathing heavily. His dick started to hurt from the amount of pressure he was building. He decided it was enough torture and went back to rubbing. A second or two later his dick shot out a few spurts of semen. He kept rubbing and more and more shot out. It landed all over him. He gave his dick one last rub and watched it soften up and slowly retract back into him. He sat, more like laid, there catching his breath. He's never cum that much in his life. It was all over his face and body.</p><p>"Holy shit..." He sits up. A string of semen dips off his face and lands into a puddle of it on his stomach. "I really need to do that more."</p><p>He stood up and looked around. There weren't any streams or rivers he could wash off in. Fuck. He couldn't go back to everyone covered in his own cum. That's gross. He uses his hand and wipes out as much as he can and flicks it away. It was still very obvious that he was out there masturbating tough. He couldn't stop blushing.</p><p>He decided to wander around for a while, hopefully, he would find something to use to clean up...</p><p>==cool break because this is where i started a new chapter on wattpad==</p><p>Knife ended up wandering all the way to the hotel, he was hot and his sweat washed off most of everything. He decided to go inside to take a shower, I mean, it wasn't against the rules right? He opens the door, OJ was in the living room watching the TV.</p><p>"Knife? Um, did you get eliminated? Usually you go through the portal." OJ pauses his show and turns to him.</p><p>"Dude Im just here to take a shower. You would think Mephone would give us a shower at least." Knife walks past him.</p><p>"You are drenched in sweat, what did you do? Walk into the sun?" He laughs. Knife rolls his eyes.</p><p>"In case you haven't been outside today, its hotter than my- its really fucking hot." Knife replies. "Now I'm gonna go take a shower and I don't know? Steal some ice cream?"</p><p>Knife makes his way upstairs, he walks past a few people who all ignore him, they must assume he was eliminated. He didn't care. Knife just wanted to wash off his day. When he entered the showers he was met face to face with Pickle.</p><p>"Knife! Hey man!" He goes in to hug Knife. Knife quickly backs up.</p><p>"Woah! Its good to see you man but you don't want to hug me..." He blushes. Fuck, everything he thought about him...</p><p>"Don't worry, Im about to take a shower. And a little sweat never hurt anymore." He laughs. Knife blushes, Pickle notices.</p><p>"It's more than just sweat man." Knife mumbles as he walks past him. Pickle lets out an "ooohh!".</p><p>"Someone had sex didn't they?" He pats Knife's back. Knife blushes harder. "Who was it? I would say pepper, right?"</p><p>"No. I didn't have sex man. Still waiting for that right person." Knife replies. He doesn't know why he's telling Pickle that. He turns on the shower to a cooler temperature than he likes.</p><p>"Woah, your a virgin?" Pickle gasps. "Not making fun! Just surprised."</p><p>"Surprised?!" Knife laughs. "Have you met me?"</p><p>"Yes, and I have also had many talks about crushes and stuff. Like half of the people in this hotel would hit." He replies, turning on his own shower in the stall next to him.</p><p>"Really? I don't believe that." Knife felt his slit loosen. Fuck.</p><p>"Well, theres kinda a rumor that you are packing, like PACKING." Pickle laughs. Knife groans and covers his face. "Yep. But hey, you ever feel up to it. We could do a bro's thing. Watch a porno together, measure dicks. We're at that level right?"</p><p>
<em>Is he saying he wants to? No... he can't.</em>
</p><p>"I don't know man. I'm not a... uh... er." Knife starts. He doesn't want to admit that he doesn't get aroused by porn.</p><p>"We could also..." Pickle takes a deep breath. "Hey Knife. Whats your sexuality?"</p><p>The room became thick, the cold shower suddenly felt colder to Knife. His body was on fire, he almost wanted to go over to Pickle's stall and have sex with him immediately.</p><p>"I'm... pan. You?" He asks. Pickle stays quiet for a bit.</p><p>"I'm bi. Heh, well. Knife, if you are ever interested, I could... um." Pickle stutters. Knife grows impatient. He just wants Pickle to stop teasing him and just fuck him already.</p><p>"Pickle, do you want to fuck me?" Knife blurts out. There's a long pause. He could almost sense Pickle's flustered body trying to think of a response.</p><p>"Well..." He spits out. Knife turns off his shower and knocks on Pickles stall. He opens it and the two connect lips immediately. This was so much action for Knife today, he was really feeling the effects of it. Knife has Pickle pinned to the wall, the amount of space between them was almost nonexistent. Their crouches grinded against each other, Pickle easily got erect. His dick slipped between Knife's legs.</p><p>"Fuck, is it supposed to come out that fast?" Knife asks.</p><p>"Dude I'm just really fucking horny." He laughs. The two go back to making out. Pickle uses one hand to rub knife's cheek and the other to rub his slit. It slowly slips out and fills Pickles hand.</p><p>"Shit... you are way bigger than what they said." Pickle bites his lip. He starts rubbing it. Knife lets out a quiet moan. "Do you want to dominate me Knife? Do you want to make me beg? Cause Im begging you to put that in me."</p><p>Knife almost passed out, Pickle was being a tease. Knife was starting to like the begging. He moved from Pickle's lips to his neck, he sucked and bit at it, leaving hickeys where ever he touched.</p><p>"I want you to beg more." He said in between spots. He wanted to make his mark on Pickle, he also tasted so good. The salty sweet taste of his pickled body was addicting.</p><p>"Please! Don't make me wait. I want you in my ass now! Please." He moans. Knife lifts Pickle up onto a shower seat, they were built in each stall for any legless guests that might come through. Pretty much everyone used it for shower sex tough. Knife spreads Pickles legs, he finally got a good look at his dick. It was a little small, but fuck was it thick. Knife lined himself up. His heart was beating so fast.</p><p>He slowly inserts himself into Pickle, who covered his mouth and groaned. It sounded exactly how he thought it was sound like. He rested, letting Pickle get used to his size.</p><p>"God man, your so big!" He gasped.</p><p>"When should I start?" He asks. Pickle waves his hands, telling him to start. Knife nods and starts to pull out and thrust back it. He watched Pickle try to keep quiet. A line a drool rolled down his face only to get swept away by the water hitting them.</p><p>"Ah! Knife you are so hot!" Pickle says in between moans. He started getting louder. Knife didn't want to get caught so he went in and started kissing Pickle again. It muffled his moans.</p><p>"Knife~ do you have any kinks?" He asks.</p><p>"I like.. edging." Knife replies in between breaths. He could feel himself getting close, his stomach started to tighten and his dick was throbbing like mad.</p><p>"Pull out all the way." Pickle demands, his tone switched. It took over knife's mind. It was sexy as hell. Pickle stood up and sat Knife down. He slowly rubbed the tip of Knife's dick. "Tell me when you're gonna cum."</p><p>"God, I can feel it. I'm gonna cum soon." He responds. Pickle stops rubbing, he keeps his thumb on the tip tough. Knife stared at him. Pickle stared back with a mischievous grin. He knew what he was doing.</p><p>"My turn to be in control." Pickle starts rubbing his own dick. "I'm gonna make you wait till I cum."</p><p>"You..." Knife could barely handle it. His dick throbbed and twitch wanting to be touched, he tried reaching for it but Pickle swatted his hand away.</p><p>"No no no! Not yet!" He starts to slow down. Knife groaned. It was horrible, but also amazing. The amount of pressure building in him was painful. He wanted to cum so bad.</p><p>"Ugh! Please! Pickle please make me cum!" Knife moans, his body twitched. He dug his fingers into his legs. Pickle watched him, he started to speed up. "Urgg. Ah... AH~ PLEASE!!" Knife started to yell, he couldn't handle it. He started breathing heavier than before. He couldn't catch his breath. This ejaculation was going to be better than last time. He could feel it. Pickle rubs his dick a few more times before he cums all over knife's face, his dick retracts back into him.</p><p>"PICKLE! PLEASE I CANT HANDLE IT AHH~" Knife shouts, his body hurt. Pickle finally rubbed Knife's dick a few more times before Knife bursts. A huge load shoots from him, followed by more short bursts. It was way more than earlier. It was quickly washed away by the shower. They sit there breathing heavily. Knife felt his legs go numb.</p><p>"Wow. I don't think I've ever seen you beg for anything, you usually just go for it." Pickle kisses Knife. Its very passionate this time, very romantic.</p><p>"You make me feel so weak.. in a good way." Knife replies. He feels tired, he can barely keep his eyes open. Pickle turns the shower off and grabs them both towels.</p><p>"Lets go back to my room, you can sleep in a bed tonight." He starts to walk away. Knife goes to stand up but his legs give out. "You can't walk and I didn't even give you anal, damn I'm good."</p><p>Pickle walks over to Knife and picks him up, Knife blushed. He started to protests, saying that he was going to get made fun of for being carried like a Princess, but Pickle just ignored him and stepped out the bathroom.</p><p>"Pickle was is as big as the rumors said!" Cheesy asks giggling. Knife smirks.</p><p>"Bigger and next time I'll use it on your mom." He laughs. Pickle almost drops him from laughing. He quickly carries him to his room and sets him on the bed.</p><p>"Here, I'll get us some water." Pickle leaves the room, leaving Knife in a flustered mess.</p><p>This was a good day...</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><br/>It was a peaceful slow day on the island, Candle decided to use that time for self-reflection. She hiked to a secluded part of the island near a hot spring, it was a way up the volcano but it was worth it. The wind was cool, which was surprising since the weather on the island was usually very hot. She dips her hand in the water, it was the perfect temperature. Candle strips naked, folding her clothing neatly and setting them on a rock nearby. She steps into the water.</p><p>It was nice, the warmth of the water loosened her body of the stress that had been building. She stretches and starts massaging her body, starting with her shoulders and down to her waist, it felt good to loosen up. After a few minutes she ended up falling asleep, she didn't realize how relaxed she was.</p><p>She dreamt of sitting on a cloud, sipping tea with what appeared to be an angel of some kind. It was relaxing, only for her to be rudely awoken by a scream. She opened her eyes to see Silver Spoon covering his eyes and blabbering about something.</p><p>"I-I'm so sorry! I didn't see anything! My goodness Candle why are you naked in the first place! I mean, I didn't see you naked! I mean-" He turns around and fans himself with his hands.</p><p>"Silver, do you need something?" She asks sitting up.</p><p>"Well, I heard from Balloon that you came up here a while ago and I decided to come to check on you- not like that! I mean- make sure you're ok?" He stutters. Candle laughs.</p><p>"Silver you seem stressed, come join me." She giggles. Silver stiffens up.</p><p>"Why I! I can't join you! It would be uncivil for me too He replies.</p><p>"Why? Because I'm a girl? And I'm naked?" Candle stands up and walks over to him. "Our bodies are nothing more than that, a body. Everyone has one, so why should be censored it?"</p><p>"With that logic why wear clothes to begin with?" He huffs.</p><p>"Because fashion is a way to express ourselves, now come join me. It's very relaxing."</p><p>"Fine but I will be facing the other wa- gah!" He turns around only to see her standing behind him. Silver starts blushing and turns away again. "Why are you! I-I can't join you, I'll be taking my leave now.</p><p>Candle reaches out to him and touches his shoulder.</p><p>"Do you find my body attractive?" She asks. He freezes up and lets out a small yelp. "Are you afraid to join me because of my body?"</p><p>"Why don't you figure it out with your mind powers or whatever." He replies, somewhat annoyed.</p><p>"Your aura is telling me that you want to have sex with me." She starts rubbing her thumb on his shoulder.</p><p>"Me?! Why that's- well!" He takes a deep breath in. "Well, who wouldn't after seeing someone so attractive."</p><p>Candle blushes and steps in front of him. She takes his hands and puts them on her shoulders.</p><p>"Well? Shall we go into the spring?" She cups his face in her hands. He agrees and steps back. "I'll be in the spring when you're ready."</p><p>After a few moments of waiting Silver Spoon steps into the water, coving himself with his hands. He whispered to himself as he sat down. Candle makes her way to him and sits on his lap, facing him. His eyes were in front of her breasts. He looks down to stop himself from staring, only to look up at the sky once he realized the sight down there wasn't any better.</p><p>"You can look, I don't mind." She rubs her hand on his cheek. He looks back at her chest, her boobs sagged slightly and were somewhat small, but man were they sexy. He couldn't help but touch them. Candle bit her lip as he gently squeezed and bounced them. He was grinning like an idiot. She let him get his feel before moving his hands to her waist.</p><p>"Are you ready?" She asks scooting forward, positioning herself. He nods and she lowers herself onto his dick. He covered his mouth.</p><p>"I should let you know this is my first time." He admits.</p><p>"I can tell, a proper gentleman like you wouldn't have gotten so excited that fast." She giggles. He rolls his eyes. She starts to move, grinding his dick with ease. She was calm and let out soft moans, Silver was the opposite. He squirmed and moaned with each bounce. From an outside perspective it would have seems like he was the one taking it rather than giving it.</p><p>Candle moved faster, her legs shook but she could feel herself getting close, she felt him start thrusting, allowing her a small break. She let him take over, he wasn't consistent with his thrusting but each push made her stomach twist and her clit throb.</p><p>"Candle, sit up! I'm He warns, Candle pushes her body up as Silver cums into the water. Candle rubbed against him until she came as well. They both stared at each other, catching their breaths. Silver covered his face.</p><p>"You did great Silver, now let's clean up." She gets out of the water and lays down in the sun. "Care to join me?" She asks.</p><p>"Alright." He agrees, stepping out of the water.</p><p>After a while, they would start hiking up to the spring for... relaxation time.</p>

<p>This fic has some shit posting in it</p><p>==</p><p>So Tea kettle, right? BIG AS TITS, you gotta agree, right? Everyone on the island even nickel's gay ass can't stop staring at those big ass tits. Like damn, mf got like an I cup or some shit- DAYUM,, zamn mommy- anyways uhh she was currently changing into her swimsuit, which had everyone on their toes. Everyone was just HOPING and PRAYING she was wearing a small and tight bikini, even though she would never,, man.</p><p>"Look guys, I may be gay, but we can all agree that tea kettle has some really nice boobs?" Nickel asks.</p><p>"Yeah, she's very attractive too!" Balloon agrees. Life ring covers his mouth.</p><p>"I may or may not have accidentally seen her braless." He mentions. WHAT.</p><p>"Really? You saw her full tits?" Nickel asks. Balloon slaps him. (Domestic violence /j)</p><p>"Well, she doesn't wear a bra to bed, and I went in to wake her up for our daily exercising, and boom, there they were. I'm so glad it was cold in the cabins too." Life ring blushes at the memory.</p><p>"I'm extremely jealous." Balloon sighs, what he would give to see that.</p><p>"..." box says. OH MY GOD. HWAT THE ACTUAL FUCK BOX. NOT FUCKING COOL.</p><p>"Woah box, that's kind of objectifying." Nickel says. Balloon and life ring agree.</p><p>"Yeah, even if she's literally the most beautiful and sexy and sweet and kind and caring and... um nice lady I would never touch her without consent." Life ring says, they agree. Everyone should agree with this. Consent is VERY IMPORTANT.</p><p>"Yeah box, maybe just sit this conversation out if you're going to say things like that." Nickel picks up box and moves him away.</p><p>"Oh life ring, balloon! Come here, sweethearts." Tea kettle waves over to them. She was standing behind a door.</p><p>"How's it going boys, now I just need your opinion my kids say I shouldn't wear this but I think it looks super cute, what do you think?" She steps into their view, and all the blood in their bodies rushed to their faces and their dicks. HOLY SHIT.</p><p>"What do you think? I thought it was cute, my kids said I shouldn't wear it though." She explained. The two didn't respond they looked at her then at each other than at her. "Are you boys ok? Does it look bad?"</p><p>"No! It's amazing!" Balloon says quickly.</p><p>"Really? I've been insecure about my body since I got divorced, my ex said I was too fat for him. This suit is my first step to feeling like my old self again" she explains.</p><p>"Divorce?! Your single?" Life ring grins, he quickly catches himself. "Uh! I mean- I'm sorry about the divorce."</p><p>"Oh it's ok, and yes, I am single." She giggles. "It was a few years ago, I should probably start trying again huh?"</p><p>"I'll take you on a date!" Balloon and life ring say at the same time. They look at each other, balloon backs off.</p><p>"I mean, life ring will take you on a date!" He coughs.</p><p>"Oh my! Really?" She blushes.</p><p>"Yeah! How about tonight?" He offers.</p><p>"It's a date! Now, let's go join the others at the beach." She walks past the two of them and makes her way to the beach.</p><p>"No way..." balloon says. He turns to life ring who is smiling like an idiot. "Life ring, you lucky bastard."</p><p>===</p><p>At the beach life ring sat on top of the lifeguard tower, watching everyone have their fun. He mostly watched everyone's reactions to tea kettle. They stared, complemented, then went back to staring. She was the center of attention at the moment.</p><p>Fuck, he couldn't wait for this date. He closed his eyes and imagined it, the two of them walking along the beach, hand in hand, she turns to him and kisses him on the cheek. She then takes her shirt off and takes his hand and places it on her chest.</p><p>"Life ring?" Someone says to him, snapping him out of his trance.</p><p>"Huh? Oh, hi Paintbrush!" He waves to them.</p><p>"Hi, I heard that you got a date with Teak kettle tonight right?" They ask, smirking.</p><p>"Well, yes! I do!"</p><p>"Some advice, she's very insecure, compliment her as much as you can. Give her this too." They hand him a sea-foam green shell, it sparkled in the sun. "We were talking about her ex and she had mentioned that he used to give her shells and pretty rocks, that's one of the main reasons they fell in love. If you want this to be more than a hookup then you better give her this."</p><p>"Hookup?! I don't think we'll go that far, it's only the first date!" He blushes.</p><p>"Trust me, she's been single for 4 years, she's looking for some action. Here's a condom, stay protected. Oh and you ever need more, the pic-nix table surprisingly supplies them." They hand him a condom and run off. Life ring stares at it... oh my.</p><p>====</p><p>It was 7:30, the time they ended up agreeing on the date. Life ring was at the pic-nix table, waiting for her to arrive. Beforehand he planted paintbrushes shell on the beach and the condom in his pocket. He noticed the woman's cabin open, tea kettle came out wearing a beautiful blue dress.</p><p>"Sorry if I'm late! Bow insisted she help with finding an outfit." She explains.</p><p>"No worries! I wasn't here long, shall we go?" He reaches his hand out to her. She takes it.</p><p>"My your hands are sweaty! Are you nervous?" She asks.</p><p>"Just a little!" He laughs, and she joins him in laughter.</p><p>"Me too. So, where are you taking me, hun?" She asks. He lead her to the beach and they made their way down the coast. It was perfect outside, the temperature was perfect, lightly cloudy, small breeze. The sunset next to them was beautiful too. Life ring stared at the ground, scared he might miss the shell. Once he saw it he picked it up and brushed the sand off it.</p><p>"Wow, this is beautiful." He says, he looks at Tea Kettle who agrees. He hands it to her. "Here, something as beautiful as this should be with someone just like it."</p><p>Tea kettle took it, and she smiled. A few tears fell from her eyes.</p><p>"Oh! I'm sorry!" He apologizes.</p><p>"No no! It's just that's similar to what my ex told me on our first date." She wiped her eyes and looked up at him. "Oh life ring, you are so sweet."</p><p>The two of them sit down and watch the sunset. Tea kettle rests her head on his shoulder.</p><p>"I was a dumb teen, dated a boy from 8th grade to 11th. He got me pregnant and I was a mom before I even finished high school. We got married and were together only a year before I was pregnant again. He then cut things off 2 years later." She looks at him. "What about you?"</p><p>"Well, I dated a few people through high school, my longest relationship lasted from 11th to a year ago. About 5 years. He then just cheated on me and left to be with her." He sighs. She rubs his back and pulls him into a sideways hug.</p><p>"Oh hun, I'm so sorry." She says rubbing his shoulder.</p><p>"It's ok, I'm sorry as well." He returns the hug.</p><p>"Oh, don't worry about it. Let's just worry about now huh?" She pulls away from the hug and kisses him. He smiles and kisses her back. They both laugh and kiss again, a longer more confident kiss.</p><p>"I think that's the first time I've kissed someone other than my ex." Tea kettle laughs.</p><p>"How was it?" He asks. She giggles.</p><p>"Better than him." She replies. They both laugh and kiss again. It soon turned into making out, life ring cups her cheek and puts a hand on her waist. They pull back after a minute or two. "Let's go somewhere private."</p><p>Life ring felt his face heat up. It was time. Time to get laid. The two of them made their way to the cabin area, life ring looked inside the boy's cabin, it was empty.</p><p>He opened the door and the two of them entered, life ring quickly put a sign on the door and turned to tea kettle who was already in her bra and underwear. Life ring takes off his shirt and pants and makes his way to her.</p><p>"You look amazing" he stares at her. The two sit down on his bed and go back to kissing. He rubbed her back and made his way to her bra. He pulled on it... he twists it... he pushes on it. Tea kettle giggles.</p><p>"Men." She reaches behind her and unhooks her bra and slides it off. Her boobs spilled out.</p><p>"WAH?!" Life ring covers his mouth. They looked even bigger than he remembered. They sagged low, to be expected from the weight of them, and also from having kids.</p><p>She takes his hands and puts them on her chest, his hands looked tiny compared to them.</p><p>"Can I do something weird?" He asks looking up at her.</p><p>"Knock yourself out." She replies. He lifts them slightly and pushes his face into her cleavage. It was warm and soft. He felt her heartbeat, it was fast. He pulled back. "Sorry, that was always a dream of mine."</p><p>"You know what a dream of mine has been?" She puts a hand on his chest and runs it down to the rim of his boxers. "To top", she whispers. Life ring lets out a small yelp. He may have been fit, but he was still tiny compared to her. He was always on the short side and she was a few inches taller than him.</p><p>She pulls him closer to him and slides his underwear off. She covers her mouth.</p><p>"So big!" She exclaims. Life ring laughs.</p><p>"It's actually pretty average." He blushes. She laughs and jokes about her ex. She gives his dick a few rubs. Life ring bites his lip. "Is this your first time with another man?"</p><p>"Yes, let's see if I know what I'm doing." She replies. She is visibly shaking, this is probably hard for her. From what she has said it seems like she didn't get much of a say in her past. It was kind of upsetting. Life ring was determined to show her that she matters in this situation.</p><p>"Tea kettle, tonight I'm all yours. Don't hold back, anything you want I'll do." He cups her cheek. She leans into it.</p><p>"Can you... pee on me?" She asks. Life ring pulls his hand away.</p><p>"I! Wow ok um." He stammers, that may have been a little more than he expected. "I can, this is a first for any kinks so."</p><p>"Same here, I just remembered seeing a video, and hey! Why the hell not!" She laughs. He takes a deep breath, he did tell her he would be hers tonight. He agrees, and brings her to the cabin's bathroom, better do it in the showers and not on his bed. When they reach the bathtub/shower thing she lays down. He stands over her. His heart beating out his chest. Was he really about to do this? He looked down at her, she didn't look to excited.</p><p>"I-I don't think I can do this!" He laughs, she joins him in laughter.</p><p>"Same here, this seems like a 3rd or 4th time thing huh?" She replies. "So do you want to have sex in the tub or can we go back to your bed?"</p><p>He takes her back to the bed, the amount of delay was almost killing him. He just really wanted to have sex. It's almost like she was teasing him. Actually, she was probably trying to see if he would chicken out.</p><p>He quickly puts on the condom Paintbrush gave him and pulls her back into a kiss, the two of them lay down. She was on her back and he laid on top of her, his dick poking at her vaginal opening. He pulls back from the kiss and grabs her hips.</p><p>"Ready whenever your are." He says. She takes a deep breath and nods. He thrusted into her, she let out a yelp and a few whines as he moved. She covered her mouth. "Are you ok?"</p><p>"Im fine! Just forgot how good this felt." She moans. He uses one hand to keep steady and the other to rub her clit. She gasped and moaned louder as he did that. She tried to say something but it was cut short by her moans. He picked up speed. The sound of wet flesh filled the room, slapping and squishing, like good mac and cheese.</p><p>"Tea kettle! I think you're really pretty!" Life ring moans, he lowers himself and kisses her stomach, she twitches and lets out a small laugh. Their moans started to sync up. He got even faster, the pressure in his stomach built up, he was going to cum. He looked up at her, and they told each other with their eyes. He thrusts into her a few more time until the two of them cum at the same time, she lets out a long deep moan. After she was done he pulls out and takes the condom off, tossing it in the trash. He lays down next to her.</p><p>"Life ring! That was amazing!" She said, trying to catch her breath. He chucked.</p><p>"Well, you get to know what the ladies want being a life guard. A lot of girl want you, and guys to!" He laughs, she scoots into him.</p><p>"You're a little but of a fuck boy huh?" She rubs his chest. He lets out a deep belly laugh.</p><p>"Hey! The correct term is man slut, and thank you!" He smirks. She rests her head on his chest, he could feel that her usually cold exterior was warm. "Weird question, is there any liquid in you head?"</p><p>Tea kettle giggles and squeezes his pec.</p><p>"Thats for another time sweetie~"</p>

<h2 class="heading">Nots so Mutual Masturbation</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Disclaimer, this isnt a foot fetish (EW GROSS *VOMITS*) they literally just dont have hands,,, so like pretend its like a hand job and not (oh my god i will throw up) a foot fetish.</p><p>=======<br/>Request by: (i cant find the user on wattpad) and Tally Hall enjoyer on Ao3!!</p><p>Two friends masturbating to porn together, that isn't weird and there is definitely not any sexual tension between them! Nope! Totally not!!</p><p>Aw who is he kidding! Nickel and Baseball are practically fucking. You see, armless objects have a difficult time masturbating they usually have a close friend help them. Its just the norm for them. Pretty much every pair that does this ends up in a relationship. But for the time being, its just a mutual masturbation.</p><p>"Hey Nickel!" Baseball runs up to Nickel who is sitting down at the soccer courts bleachers.</p><p>"Sup, you find any good videos for tonight?" He asks turning to his friend.</p><p>"Sure did, I also went ahead and asked OJ for the projector." Baseball sits down next to him.</p><p>"Ah, going big today? Just like your di-" Nickel starts before Baseball covers his mouth.</p><p>"Sh! Lightbulb is lily right there?" He points over to Lightbulb who was throwing a basketball into the soccer goal, she notices them and waves.</p><p>"I can promise you she cant hear us but whatever." He rolls his eyes. Baseball laughs and the two share mild conversation for a bit. It was almost 7, they decide to go ahead and make their way to the hotel. Once inside they ate a quick dinner, KFC bought by Pickle who was currently passed out on the couch. He wouldn't mind if they took some.</p><p>In Baseball's room the two hook up the projector screen and pull up the video Baseball chose for the night. It started playing, normal porno things, hello blah blah blah sexual innuendo followed by a pan down to a vagina being penetrated by a dick.</p><p>The two casually watch it, neither one of them getting hard. Maybe today wasn't a good day for this?</p><p>"Hey Nickel, can I ask you something?" He scoots closer to his friend.</p><p>"Sure man, maybe it'll get me hard faster." He laughs. Baseball takes a deep breath.</p><p>"Do you want to have sex this time?" He asks. Nickel's face turns a deep red. "Like jerking each other is cool but... yeah."</p><p>"I mean, yeah, we can? Um, who's going in who though?" Nickel asks, looking Baseball up and down.</p><p>"I would probably cause internal damage, you can do me. Wait that sounded kinda weird." He replies. Nickel smirks, as if something in him clicked.</p><p>"Oh I see, you want me to do something kinky huh?" He asks. Baseball chokes on the air.</p><p>"Wh?! Well?? Ok this is really new to me... can you like talk dirty to me or something? Not anything mean please." He asks, his face on fire.</p><p>"Sure, now (how should I do this), uh, let me see your dick bitch." He places a foot on Baseball's stomach. Without hesitation he gets hard. "I bet you want me so bad? You think about me at night huh? You want me to fuck you?"</p><p>"Please.." Baseball ushers out. Nickel licks Baseball's dick and positions his dick in front of Baseball's ass. He thrusts in and Baseball twitches, letting out a small yelp.</p><p>"You like that you whore?" Nickel asks. He started to enjoy these questions, it made him feel hot and powerful.</p><p>"Yes- um can I call you master?" He asks.</p><p>"Oh you like that weird shit, you dirty slut." Nickel nods. He keeps thrusting into Baseball. He goes to reply but keeps getting the words taken out of his mouth by each thrust.</p><p>"I do! Master, call me a whore again!" Baseball asks in between breaths. A line of droll rolled down his face. Nickel leans in and licks Baseball's dick at the tip. His small size mean it was easy to reach both.</p><p>He kissed and licked at the tip. He takes in a small bit, it fills his mouth. He chokes on it and pulls away, coughing.</p><p>"Oh! Hey you ok?" Baseball sits up and check on his friend.</p><p>"Yeah- I didn't think my gag reflex was that bad." Nickel coughs out. Baseball laughs and shakes his head.</p><p>"Hey go ahead and take a sec, in the mean time." He lays Nickel down and lick's his dick instead. He sucks on it and uses a small bit of teeth to rub the tip. Nickel squirms.</p><p>"Hey! I'm the one in control here!" He moans out. Baseball giggles and continues to tease him.</p><p>"Sorry Master! Your popsicle just looked so tasty!!" He replies.</p><p>"Popsicle..."</p><p>"Yeah that sounded really dumb, forget I said that." He blushes, embarrassed.</p><p>"Don't pity yourself, keep sucking bitch!" Nickel demands. Baseball goes back to it. He brings it all into his mouth. He licks what he can inside his mouth and pulls back sucking slightly to give it some tension. Nickel bucked his hips up which cause him to fill Baseball's mouth again.</p><p>"Holy shit-" Nickel moaned. Baseball sped up, bobbing his head up and down in a steady but fast pace. Nickel stretched his leg out to jerk Baseball off, the angle wasn't the best but he did what he could. He used his feet to quickly rub up and down on his dick. Baseball let out moans, the vibrations from it made the blow job even nicer. Nickel felt Baseball cum onto his leg, that didn't stop him though.</p><p>"Fuck! Do you want me to cum in your mouth?" Nickel asks he had been trying his hardest to not cum. Baseball nods. Nickel sighs in relief and relaxes his lower half. Baseball takes in his entire dick one last time before he came. It shot into the back of his throat, it wasn't the best feeling but he also really enjoyed the feeling. Baseball sat up and swallowed.</p><p>The two stared at each other. An awkward silence fell over the room. The two both started laughing.</p><p>"Aw man, did I seriously call you master?" Baseball laughed.</p><p>"Hey, I kinda liked it!" Nickel replies sitting up. He grabs some tissues and starts to clean up Baseball's cum that was slowly seeping into the sheets.</p><p>"We should do this more often. Like, as a couple? Also yeah asking you to be my boyfriend after we literally just had sex is stupid, don't make fun of me." Baseball blushes. Nickel smirks and tosses the tissue away.</p><p>"I would like that, bitch." He replies leaning in to kiss Baseball. The two connect lips, a deep kiss. Nickel pulls back first. "Just remember you had my dick in you mouth and I don't think I want that in my mouth just yet."</p><p>"Yeah no that cool." Baseball laughs. Nickel scoots over to cuddle into him. He rests his head against him, Baseball was slightly deflated which made him the perfect pillow.</p><p>"Lets clean the sheet tomorrow, night Nickel."</p><p>"Night... bitch." He lets out a small laugh.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>"Ah~ Oh!" Fan covers his face as he bites back his not so quiet moans. He had his blanket pulled over his head and a action movie loudly playing on his laptop to hopefully cover his moans from Paintbrush who was sleeping across the room. He felt himself getting close, he picked up speed.</p><p>Brr Brr</p><p>His laptop popped up a facetime from TestTube. He panicked, pulling his pants back up quickly and throwing the blanket away. He picks up.</p><p>"FAN!!!" She yells, all he could see was her eye. She fumbled with her phone and he got a face full of her (covered up) boob. He looked away.</p><p>"Um, whats up? Its 3 in the morning." He asks. TestTube brings her phone to her face.</p><p>"Sorry, I kinda lose track of time in the lab- oh! Come here!! You need to see this!" She shouts, a huge smile on her face.</p><p>"Ok, I'll head over in like 5 mins." He replies. His dick was starting to hurt, god he needed to cum.</p><p>"Now!! Actually wait, ill just show you on here-" She lays her phone down and messes with something next to her. In less than a second Fan had gone from his bed to next to TestTube.</p><p>"Wha?!" He falls back.</p><p>"HAHA!! It worked!! I made a teleporter!!" She yells. Fan scrambles to cover himself more, the one time he goes commando has to be when he wears sweatpants...</p><p>"You teleported me?" He yells. TestTube stops doing her "science dance" and turns to him. She looks really tired.</p><p>"Yes! How did it feel? Did it hurt?" She kneels down next to him.</p><p>"Um, I didn't feel anything? Can I go back now?" He replies.</p><p>"Go back?? No, Fan I need to do more tests! Imagine!!" She lifts him up. He lets out a small yelp (more like a moan). She was really strong. He felt his stomach tighten and a nice release. Oh my god he fucking came.. curse you strong sexy women. He we lucky his sweatpants were black and not gray. He could at least hid the cum spot. He felt gross.</p><p>"TestTube I really need to leave." He blushes. She sets him down.</p><p>"Sorry, um, Fan, we can do more tests in the morning. But uh," She takes a deep breath in. "Look."</p><p>She takes his hand and brings him to her bed, it was covered in coffee cups and energy drink cans. Oh my god..</p><p>"Can I sleep in your bed?" She asks.</p><p>"TestTube you need to stop drinking so much caffeine. Also just sleep in the hotel's bed? You have one." He says.</p><p>"DO YOU KNOW HOW LOUD MIC SNORES???" She shakes him. Fan apologizes. "Sorry, I haven't slept more than 3 hours in over a week and I think I'm hallucinating." She looks over his shoulder at something behind them, there wasn't anything there..</p><p>"Ok, just don't wake up Paintbrush. They sleep fight." He remembers the last time he woke them up... oh god.</p><p>"Thanks Fan! Now lets take the teleporter back!!" She jumps over to her computer. Fan looks down at his pants. It was starting to stick to him, an outline of his dick was obviously showing. He readjusts to hopefully cover it up. TestTube does an excited stim and presses enter. The two were back in Fan's room. Paintbrush must have woken up when he was gone because his laptop was closed and on the nightstand. Paintbrush was also not in the room anymore.</p><p>"Hehe!! That was fun!" TestTube whispers, at least she's being quiet. She falls back onto Fan's bed and almost immediately falls asleep. He lets out a small chuckle. He takes off her shoes and puts them next to his nightstand, I don't think sleeping in work shoes is very comfortable.</p><p>Fan quickly cleans up his er... mess, changes into underwear and a new pair of black sweatpants. He looks back at TestTube, she was dead asleep. He lays down next to her and pulls the blankets over them. He should get some sleep too.</p><p>===</p><p>TestTube pulled her pillow over her head. The sun was shining directly in her eyes. She wasn't tired enough to go back asleep but she really didn't want to get out of bed. Fan was cuddled into her and he looked to cute to wake up!</p><p>But, she had to piss, sorry Fan. She isn't going to risk kidney diseases for your comfort! TestTube slipped out of bed and pulled the blanket over Fan, who didn't even react to her moving.</p><p>After making her way to the bathroom she glanced in the mirror. She looked like a mess, her glass was smudged and was that a crack?! Not to mention her outfit had burn marks all over it. She makes another quick stop to her room for some new clothing, preferably something more comfortable. After a quick shower she returns to Fan's.... Room.</p><p>He was still sleeping, but uh, guess he gets morning wood. He was sprawled out in his bed with a very obvious tent in his pants. She blushed. Her and Fan had a weird relationship, not a couple, but they could talk about private situations or get changed in front of each other. This was different, they haven't had a... sexual situation before. Maybe now? No! Just wake him up!!</p><p>"F-Fan." She shakes him. He groans and rubs his eyes.</p><p>"Wh? Where year is then?" He asks. What?</p><p>"Fan, wake up." She rolls her eyes. He opens his eyes and looks at her.</p><p>"Oh! Morning Testy!" He stretches. His eyes go wide. "Ah! TestTube!!" He pulls the blanket over him. "What uh, what brings you here? Wait you slept here.. um, hi! Morning?"</p><p>"Fan, I have a question." She asks, a slight blush on her face.</p><p>"C-can it wa-"</p><p>"Can we have sex?" She asks. Fan lets out a squeak. "Not sex sex, I'm on my period, but can I give you a handjob?"</p><p>Fan stares at her, his dick is throbbing yes, but he can't spit it out. He covers his face and nods. TestTube crawls into the bed and sits on his legs. She lays him back and pulls the blanket off of him, rubbing this dick through his clothes. He twitches at her touch. She pulls his pants down, his dick springs out and lays back.</p><p>TestTube rubs his inner thigh and fondles his balls, squeezing them softly. Fan bites his lip. She then uses the hand she was rubbing his thigh with the start rubbing his dick. She starts slowly, using her index, middle, and thumb to pull his foreskin down. She builds speed, Fan lets out soft gasps. She grips his length with the rest of her fingers and speeds up more.</p><p>"Oh! Oh my g!! Ah! TestTube!!" Fan moans, he throws his head back, a line of drool escapes his mouth, he can barely catch his breath. She stops squeezing his balls and starts rubbing the tip of his dick, this caused him to get louder.</p><p>"Ah!! Tes- TestTu- oh my! Ah~!!" He moans. She feels precum start to spill from him, she decides its time to go as fast as she can. She squeezes his dick harder and leans down to get steadier. Fan takes a deep breath in and cums into her hand, exhaling as he did. TestTube pulls her hand away and looks at his semen.</p><p>"Your dehydrated." She says watching it slowly drip down her hand.</p><p>"Did you do all of that just to tell me to drink more water?" He asks, still catching his breath.</p><p>"No! I did it because I'm horny. Now, pull up your pants and lets go look at this under a microscope!" She says excitedly. Fan rolls his eyes.</p><p>"Fan. TestTube." Someone says from the door. The two of them turn to see Paintbrush holding a glass of water, looking utterly disgusted.</p><p>"Oh, hi..." TestTube replies.</p><p>"Next time please lock the door." Paintbrush turns around and pours the glass of water they had on their face, probably to wash what they witnessed away.</p>
